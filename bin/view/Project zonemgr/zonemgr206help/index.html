System Administration Commands                        zonemgr(1M)

NAME
     zonemgr - set up and manage zones

SYNOPSIS
     Normal usage:
     zonemgr -a  [options]

     See proper usage:
     zonemgr -h

     Display the version:
     zonemgr -v

     Display the license:
     zonemgr -l 

DESCRIPTION
     The purpose of zonemgr is to simplify Solaris 10 and 
     OpenSolaris zones management.  There are many pre-defined 
     actions that can be applied to one or more zones 
     depending on the action. 

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -a      Specify the action to be performed

     -n    Specify the name of the zone

     -h              See this usage information

     -l              See the CDDL license

     -v              See the version number of this script

     -f 
                     Where the contents of the config_file
                     consists of normal command line arguments
                     with one flag/argument per line.  Here is 
                     the contents of a basic example config_file 
                     example:
                        # zonemgr -f /data/m1_zone.cfg
                     The contents of /data/m1_zone.cfg are as follows:
                     &lt;~-- File Begins Here ~--&gt;
                     -a add 
                     -n m1 
                     -z "/zones" 
                     -P "abc123" 
                     -I "192.168.0.10|hme0|24|m1"
                     &lt;~-- File Ends Here ~--&gt;

ACTIONS
     Actions which can result in data loss or can significantly 
     alter the server configuration will require authorization.
     To confirm all such changes, you may use the -F flag to 
     answer yes to all such authorizations.

     The following actions are supported:

     info [-n ]
         The "info" action displays configuration information 
         about one or more zones.  If a zone name is not 
         provided, the info action displays the full 
         configuration for all non-global zones.

     resinfo [-n ]
         The "resinfo" action displays all resource management
         configuration information about one or more zones. If 
         a zone name is not provided, the resinfo action 
         displays the resource management information for all 
         non-global zones.

     add -n  [add_options]
         The "add" action adds a new non-global zone.

                            The zonepath is the subdirectory
                            below the zone root directory. For
                            example, specifying -z /myzones
                            would result in the following root
                            zone directory:
                            /myzones/
                            where  is the name of 
                            the zone you are creating.

                            If no zonepath is specified, the 
                            default value of zonepath is /zones.

                            If the filesystem containing the 
                            zonepath is a ZFS filesystem, a 
                            new ZFS filesystem will be created 
                            for the zone directory.  If no
                            ZFS filesystem is specified in the
                            optional second pipe (|) delmited
                            field, the default value will be the
                            ZFS pool containing the root (/) 
                            filesystem.  In most cases this is
                            rpool.  In this case, the ZFS
                            filesystem would be rpool/

                            Optionally, you may also specify 
                            a semicolon (;) delimited list of ZFS
                            options in the third pipe (|) delimited
                            field as well.  For example, the 
                            following would create a ZFS filesystem
                            (rpool/z1) with the mountpoint of /z 
                            and optional enables the gzip
                            compression algorithm and disables atime.

                            -z "/z|rpool/z1|compression=gzip;atime=off"

                            The zonedir is the zone root
                            directory. Specifying -Z /z1
                            will place the zone root directory
                            in /z1.

                            If no zonepath is specified, the 
                            default value of zonepath is
                            /zones/

                            If the filesystem containing the 
                            zonedir is a ZFS filesystem, a 
                            new ZFS filesystem will be created 
                            for the zone directory.  If no
                            ZFS filesystem is specified in the
                            optional second pipe (|) delmited
                            field, the default value will be the
                            ZFS pool containing the root (/) 
                            filesystem.  In most cases this is
                            rpool.  In this case, the ZFS
                            filesystem would be rpool/

                            Optionally, you may also specify 
                            a semicolon (;) delimited list of ZFS
                            options in the third pipe (|) delimited
                            field as well.  For example, the 
                            following would create a ZFS filesystem
                            (rpool/z) with the mountpoint of /z,
                            enables the gzip compression algorithm
                            and disables atime.

         The following add_options can be used as substitutes for
         the required options:

         The following optional add_options are supported:

         -t         Type of zone where w=Whole Root and 
                            s=Sparse Root.  A sparse root zone
                            inherits the following directories
                            from the global zone: /lib, /usr, 
                            /sbin, and /platform. A whole root
                            zone does not inherit any directories
                            from the global zone. The default
                            value is sparse root (s).

                            OpenSolaris does not share the same
                            definitions of sparse and whole root
                            zones as Solaris 10.  For OpenSolaris,
                            all zones whole root zones.  Further,
                            the package set installed in a zone is
                            a significantly smaller subset of the
                            packages contained in the global zone.
                            This ensures that the zone is minimized
                            by default.  Adding packages to
                            to OpenSolaris is significantly easier
                            though than it was for Solaris 10. More

                            interface listed by ifconfig.  The 
                            default netmask is the netmask that 
                            corresponds to the IP address that 
                            you specify. There is no default host

                            network interfaces will be exclusive
                            to this zone.  When the exclusive 
                            option is invoked, it must be included
                            with each interface and, a default

                            the non-global zone ().  
                            There are two phases of zone boot process 
                            in which you can copy data into the non-
                            global.  The first and default phase 
                            (

{{{
) is before the zone boots for the 
                            first time.  The second phase () 
                            is after the zone complets its last 
                            boot of the zone creation process.

                            Data copied from the global zone can be
                            a file or directory.  All data will be 
                            recursively copied from the global zone
                            into the non-global zone.

                            Note that filesystems specified with -r
                            and -w will not be created until after
                            the zone has completed its first boot.
                            Thus do not expect that pre-boot copies
                            will go into a filesystem that you have
                            specified with the -r or -w options.

     del -n  [-F]
         The del action deletes an existing zone

         The "del" action supports the following optional option:

         -F                 Don't confirm an action; Just do it.

     modify -n 
         The "modify" action enables you to add, modify and delete
         select zone properties.  Zone properties that can be modified
         include the following:

             Modify the zone name:
               -m "zonename:"

             Modify the comment that describes the zone:
               -m "comment:"

             Modify the autoboot value.  The autoboot property determines
             whether or not the zone will boot when the global zone is 
             booted.
               -m "autoboot:"

             Modify the boot arguments of the zone:
               -m "bootargs:"

             Modify an existing filesystem (fs) property:
               -m "fs:|:"
                     Where net resource types include the following:
                        dir - Global zone directory
                        special - Non-global zone directory
                        options - Filesystem mount options

             Modify an existing network property:
               -m "net:|:"
                     Where net resource types include the following:
                        address - Network address and netmask in CIDR format
                        physical - The network interface

             Modify a resource management property:
               -m "||"
                     Where action include the following:
                        add - Add a resource
                        del - Delete a resource
                        mod - Modify a resource
                        move - Move a resource from the existing zone to 
                               another zone on the same system.  When 
                               using this action, you must also supply
                               the source zone name with the -y 
                               parameter.

                     Where resource types include the following:
                        cpu - A CPU resource cap
                        dcpu - A dedicated CPU resource
                        ram - A memory resource cap
                        dram - A locked memory resource
                        swap - A virtual memory resource cap

                     Where the resource_arg is either a fixed number, a 
                     range, or a scaled amount.  The types for each
                     resource type are listed below:
                        For cpu and dcpu resource times, the resource_arg
                        is either a fixed number or a range of CPUs.

                        For ram, dram or swap resource, the resource_arg
                        is the amount and scale where the scale is
                        represnted by K, M, G, or T.  For example, 1M is 
                        one megabyte.

         Zone properties that can be removed include the following:

             Remove a filesystem from the zone configuration:
               -m "del:fs:"

             Remove a ZFS volume from the zone configuration:
               -m "del:zvol:"

             Remove a ZFS dataset from the zone configuration:
               -m "del:dset:"

             Remove a network interface from the zone configuration:
               -m "del:net:"

         In addition to modifying and deleting existing properties, 
         you can also add a few types of properties.  The arguments 
         used to add these properties are listed below.

         -I "||||[exclusive|default_router]"
                            IP Address of the non-global zone 
                            plus the network interface for that 
                            IP address, the netmask in CIDR 
                            format, and the host name for that IP
                            address.

                            If not specified the default network 
                            interface is the first non-loopback 
                            interface listed by ifconfig.  The 
                            default netmask is the netmask that 
                            corresponds to the IP address that 
                            you specify. There is no default host
                            name.

                            If the word exclusive is optionally
                            added after the hostname, then all 
                            network interfaces will be exclusive
                            to this zone.  When the exclusive 
                            option is invoked, it must be included
                            with each interface and, a default 
                            router must be supplied for each 
                            interface even if it is the same 
                            default router for all interfaces.

                            Note that a zone can be created 
                            without a network address.

                            There are two phases of zone boot process

{{{
) is before the zone boots for the 
                            first time.  The second phase () 
                            is after the zone complets its last 
                            boot of the zone creation process.

                            Data copied from the global zone can be
                            a file or directory.  All data will be 
                            recursively copied from the global zone

                            the zone has completed its first boot.
                            Thus do not expect that pre-boot copies
                            will go into a filesystem that you have
                            specified with the -r or -w options.

         The "clone" action clones an existing zone into a
         new zone.  The new zone can be tailored via the
         optional arguments used when creating a new zone.

         The "clone" action supports the following required 
         options:

         The following clone_options are required:

         -P ""

                            of this new non-global zone.  The 
                            password can either be specified in
                            a file or as a quoted string.

            OR

         -E "" 
                            This is an alternate way from 
                            -P  of specifying the non-

                            encrypted format.  The encrypted 
                            password can either be specified in
                            a file or as a quoted string.  You 
                            can copy and paste the users 
                            password from /etc/shadow.  

         -z "||"
                            The zonepath is the subdirectory
                            below the zone root directory. For
                            example, specifying -z /myzones
                            would result in the following root
                            zone directory:
                            /myzones/
                            where  is the name of 
                            the zone you are creating.

                            If no zonepath is specified, the 
                            default value of zonepath is /zones.

                            If the filesystem containing the 
                            zonepath is a ZFS filesystem, a 
                            new ZFS filesystem will be created 
                            for the zone directory.  If no
                            ZFS filesystem is specified in the
                            optional second pipe (|) delmited
                            field, the default value will be the
                            ZFS pool containing the root (/) 
                            filesystem.  In most cases this is
                            rpool.  In this case, the ZFS
                            filesystem would be rpool/

                            Optionally, you may also specify 
                            a semicolon (;) delimited list of ZFS
                            options in the third pipe (|) delimited
                            field as well.  For example, the 
                            following would create a ZFS filesystem
                            (rpool/z1) with the mountpoint of /z 
                            and optional enables the gzip
                            compression algorithm and disables atime.

                            -z "/z|rpool/z1|compression=gzip;atime=off"

            OR

         -Z "||"
                            The zonedir is the zone root
                            directory. Specifying -Z /z1
                            will place the zone root directory
                            in /z1.

                            If no zonepath is specified, the 
                            default value of zonepath is
                            /zones/

                            If the filesystem containing the 
                            zonedir is a ZFS filesystem, a 
                            new ZFS filesystem will be created 
                            for the zone directory.  If no
                            ZFS filesystem is specified in the
                            optional second pipe (|) delmited
                            field, the default value will be the
                            ZFS pool containing the root (/) 
                            filesystem.  In most cases this is
                            rpool.  In this case, the ZFS
                            filesystem would be rpool/

                            Optionally, you may also specify 
                            a semicolon (;) delimited list of ZFS
                            options in the third pipe (|) delimited
                            field as well.  For example, the 
                            following would create a ZFS filesystem
                            (rpool/z) with the mountpoint of /z,
                            enables the gzip compression algorithm
                            and disables atime.

                            -Z "/z|rpool/z|compression=gzip;atime=off"

         The following optional clone_options are supported:

                            according to the type.  Note that for all
                            filesystems but the lofi/lofs filesystem, 
                            the device is mounted for exclusive use of
                            the non-global zone.  However, the root 
                            user in the global zone can access the 
                            contents of the mounted filesystem because 
                            the root mount point of the non-global zone 
                            is accessible as a directory in the global

EXAMPLES

     Example 1:  Create A Zone

     The following command will create a non-global zone named 
     m1.

         # zonemgr -a add -n m1 -P "abc123" \
             -I "192.168.0.10|hme0|24|m1"

     Example 2:  Create A Zone With Custom ZFS Root Zone Directory

     If the root filesystem (mount point = /) is a ZFS filesystem,
     the Zone Manager will need to create a ZFS filesystem to serve
     as the root zone directory.  Since the zone root directory is
     a ZFS filesystem, you can specify a specifi zpool in which to
     create the filesystem as well as customize attributes of that
     filesystem.  Further, all options set for the ZFS based zone
     root directory will be inherited by all ZFS filesystems below
     the zone root directory.  For example, the following command
     will 
       1. create the zone m1 
       2. with a ZFS filesystem (zdata/m1) as the zone root directory 
       3. with a global zone mountpoint of /zones/m1 
       4. in the "zdata" ZFS pool,
       5. and it will enable gzip compression of the zdata/m1 ZFS
          filesystem
       6. and the recordsize to 8k of the zdata/m1 ZFS filesystem

         # zonemgr -a add -n m1 -P "abc123" \
             -Z "/zones/m1|zdata/m1|compression=gzip;recordsize=8k"

     Note that for the -z and -Z flags, that the ZFS filesystem
     (the second pipe delimited field) is the ZFS filesystem that
     will be used for the zone root directory and not as the base
     plus the zone name.  In other words, we are creating a zone 
     named m2 and have specified -z zdata, the resulting ZFS 
     filesystem will be just zdata and not be zdata/m2.  This is a
     very important distinction because -z flag appends the zone
     name to the end of the base directory specified by the -z 
     flag but does not do so for the ZFS filesystem.  The reason
     for this decision is because some customers needed to 
     specify the ZFS filesystem independently of the zone name.

     Example 3:  Delete A Zone

     The following command will delete the non-global zone named
     m1 and it will not be prompted to continue because the 
     action is forced with the -F flag.

         # zonemgr -F -a del -n m1

     Example 4:  Create A Zone With Multiple IP Addresses

     The following command will create a non-global zone named 
     m1 with three IP addresses where each IP address is configured
     on its own network interface.  Note that the third option has
     specified that it will exclusively use the bge1 network 
     interface.  The other IP addresses are assigned to shared
     network interfaces (hme0 and bge0).

         # zonemgr -a add -n m1 -P "abc123"  \
             -I "192.168.0.10|hme0|24|m1"  \
             -I "192.168.5.27|bge0|24|m2"  \
             -I "192.168.10.5|bge1|24|m3|exclusive|192.168.10.5" 

     Example 5: A Complex Example

     The following command will perform the details stated below.
         # zonemgr -a add -n m2 -t w  \
             -P "abc123" -R /root  \
             -I "192.168.0.10|hme0|24|m2"  \
             -r "/ds/build11/bits|/bits"  \
             -w "/zones/m2|/ds/m2"  \
             -s "basic|lock" -S ssh  \
             -C /etc/ssh/sshd_config  \
             -L "default;dtrace_proc;dtrace_user"

   1. Create a whole root zone named m2 in /zones/m2.
   2. Set the root password of that zone to abc123.
   3. Set the home directory of the root user of the non-global 
      zone to /root.
   4. Set the IP address of the zone to 192.168.0.10, the
      netmask to 255.255.255.0, assign it to interface hme0, and
      assign it a host name of m2.
   5. Read only mount /ds/build11/bits from the global zone to 
      /bits in the non-global zone.
   6. Read write mount /zones/m2 from the global zone to /ds/m2 
      in the non-global zone.
   7. Disable all un-necessary services in the non-global zone
      and restart the ssh service once the lockdown is complete. 
   8. Copy the /etc/ssh/sshd_config, /etc/resolv.conf, and
      /etc/nsswitch.conf files from the global zone to the 
      non-global zone. The resolv.conf and nsswitch.conf are
      copied for convenience only if they are present in the 
      global zone.
   9. Add the dtrace_proc and dtrace_user privileges to the
      non-global zone

     Example 6:  List All Zones

     The following command will list all available zones.

         # zonemgr -a list

     Example 7:  Reboot A Zone

     The following command will reboot non-global zone m1.

         # zonemgr -a reboot -n m1

     Example 8: Disable Un-necessary Services

     The following command will disable all un-necessary services
     of non-global zone m1.

         # zonemgr -a modify -n m1 -s "basic|lock" 

     Example 9: Enable Un-necessary Services

     The following command will enable all un-necessary services
     of non-global zone m1.

         # zonemgr -a modify -n m1 -s "basic|unlock" 

     Example 10: Manage State Of Multiple Zones

     The following command will halt all non-global zones but 
     those specified by the -n parameter and will boot any of the
     specified zones that are not currently running.

         # zonemgr -a only -n "m1;m2"

     Example 11: Halt All Zones

     The following command will halt all non-global zones.

         # zonemgr -a only -n "haltall"

     Example 12: Boot All Zones

     The following command will boot all non-global zones.

         # zonemgr -a only -n "bootall"

     Example 13: Creating A BrandZ (e.g. Linux) Zone

     The following command will add a BrandZ zone
         # zonemgr -a add -n m1 -P "abc123"  \
             -I "192.168.0.10|hme0|24|m1"  \
             -B "SUNWlx|all|/data/brandz/centos_fs_image.tar" 

     The parameters passed to -B break down as follows:
         * SUNWlx: The zone brand (only lx is currently supported)

         * On opensolaris ipkg is the default brand. Do not specify
           ipkg it will be installed by default on opensolaris.

         * all: The brand subset to install. Valid values include 
           desktop, applications, server, development, system, 
           and all. I don't yet have an idea as to how this 
           option will impact other distributions that folks come
           up with. These options may or may not be valid. TBD.

         * /data/brandz/centos_fs_image.tar: The path to the 
           brand bits. I simply pointed them to the BrandZ 
           community's CentOS image.

     Example 14: Create A Zone AND Install MySQL5 From BlastWave

     The following command will add a zone named m1, download and
     install mysql5 and all requisite bits from Blastwave.org, 
     and install all those bits in the proper order in the m1 
     zone. 
         # zonemgr -a add -n m1 -P "abc123"  \
             -I "192.168.0.10|hme0|24|m1" -G "mysql5"

     Example 15: Add A ZFS Filesystem To An Existing Zone

     The following command will create a legacy mode ZFS 
     filesystem from the myzfspool pool, set the ZFS mount 
     point to /zfsdata, and mount that filesystem exclusively
     within the m1 zone.
         # zonemgr -a modify -n m1 -w "zfs|/zfsdata|zpool/m1data"

     Example 16: Move A Zone

     The following command will move a zone to a new directory.
         # zonemgr -a move -n m1 -Z /zones/newm1 

     Example 17: Detach And Attach A Zone

     The following two commands will detach a zone and then
     re-attach it.
         # zonemgr -a detach -n m1 -F
         # zonemgr -a attach -n m1 -F

     Example 18: Clone A Zone

     The following command will move a zone to a new directory.
         # zonemgr -a clone -n m1 -y m1clone -Z /zones/m1clone  \
            -P "pw"

     Example 19: Apply CPU Containment To A Zone

     The following command will put a zone into a CPU processor 
     set that will limit all process of the zone to running on
     the specified number of CPUs.
         # zonemgr -a modify -n m1 -p "cpu|1"

     Example 20: Apply Memory Containment To A Zone

     The following command will dedicate 1G of physical memory 
     to a zone.
         # zonemgr -a modify -n m1 -p "dram|1g"

NOTES
     Note that most parameters are multivalued.  In other words,
     you can specify the same parameter multiple times.  For 
     example, to mount the /data1 and /data2 directories in read 
     only mode from the global zone to the non-global zone, add 
     the following to the add action:
       -r "/data1" -r "/data2"

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0        Successful completion.

     1        An error occurred.

     2        Invalid usage.
