            reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
            distribute the Original Software (or portions thereof),
            with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger
            Work; and

        (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or
            selling of Original Software, to make, have made, use,
            practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise
            dispose of the Original Software (or portions thereof).

        (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are
            effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
            or otherwise makes the Original Software available to a
            third party under the terms of this License.

        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
            granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original
            Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the
            modification of the Original Software, or (ii) the
            combination of the Original Software with other software
            or devices.

    2.2. Contributor Grant.

    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
    subject to third party intellectual property claims, each
    Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive license:

        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
            trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce,
            modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the
            Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions
            thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other
            Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part of a
            Larger Work; and

        (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
            selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either
            alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version
            (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell,
            offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of:
            (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions
            thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by
            that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions
            of such combination).

        (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
            effective on the date Contributor first distributes or
            otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third
            party.

        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
            granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted
            from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused
            by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor Version,
            or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that
            Contributor with other software (except as part of the
            Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent
            Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            Modifications made by that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
    available in Executable form must also be made available in Source
    Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
    the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of this
    License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
    Software You distribute or otherwise make available.  You must
    inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form
    as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
    form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
    used for software exchange.

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License.  You represent that You
    believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
    You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
    License.

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may
    not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
    contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
    or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
    the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
    of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  You may
    choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
    Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
    You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability terms You offer.

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
    under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
    Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
    the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the
    Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
    must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
    Developer or Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the
    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
    such terms You offer.

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
    other code not governed by the terms of this License and
    distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case,
    You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
    for the Covered Software.

    4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
    publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
    time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
    Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
    steward has the right to modify this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
    License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
    If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
    Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
    available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
    distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
    of the version of the License under which You originally received
    the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
    the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
    and remove any references to the name of the license steward
    (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
    (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
    differ from this License.

    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
    SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY
    COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF
    WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF
    ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
    DISCLAIMER.

    6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
    the termination of this License shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
    assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
    the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
    the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
    the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
    the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
    under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
    notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
    such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
    Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
    or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
    LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
    STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF
    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
    INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
    APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
    NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
    APPLY TO YOU.

    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
    defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
    computer software" (as that term is defined at 48
    C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
    documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
    (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
    rights set forth herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
    lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
    provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
    under this License.

    9. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable.  This License shall be governed
    by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
    if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
    conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this
    License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
    in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
    for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
    reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the
    United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
    of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which
    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
    against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  You agree
    that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
    States export administration regulations (and the export control
    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
    distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing
    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
    of liability.

    4. Java Compatibility and Open Source.

    Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
    developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and
    open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its
    products.
    
    Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
    open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
    the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not

    5. Term and Termination.
    
    The Agreement is effective on the Date you receive the Software and

    will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially
    breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its
    licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should
    any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become,
    the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade
    secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and
    destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1,

    Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of

    the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and
    Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's
    option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.
    Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so
    the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you
    specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to
    state.
    
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    
    UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
    ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO
    BE LEGALLY INVALID.
    
    8. Limitation of Liability.
    
    TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
    LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
    REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
    USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you,
    whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
    the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing
    limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
    essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
    or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
    applicable to you.
    
    9. Export Regulations.
    
    All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials
    delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws

    by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
    then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation

    licensed, not sold, to you by Sun.  Sun reserves all rights not expressly
    granted.
    
    (b) You may not modify Software.  However if the documentation

    files, that may be handled differently, you may do so only as provided in
    the documentation.

    (g) Software is copyrighted.
    
    (h) Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design,

    classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under
    compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available
    at www.java.net.
    
    Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
    developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and
    open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its
    products.
    
    Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
    open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
    the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not
    alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source
    licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
    liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in
    this distribution.
    
    5. Term and Termination.
    
    The Agreement is effective on the Date you receive the Software and
    remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement
    will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially
    breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its
    licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should
    any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become,
    the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade
    secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and
    destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1,
    3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.
    
    6. Limited Warranty.
    
    Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
    receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free
    of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for
    the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and
    Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's
    option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.
    Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so
    the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you
    specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to
    state.
    
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    
    UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
    ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO
    BE LEGALLY INVALID.
    
    8. Limitation of Liability.
    
    TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
    LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
    REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
    USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you,
    whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
    the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing
    limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
    essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
    or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
    applicable to you.
    
    9. Export Regulations.
    
    All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials
    delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws

    accompanying Software lists specific portions of Software, such as header 
    files, class libraries, reference source code, and/or redistributable 
    files, that may be handled differently, you may do so only as provided in 
    the documentation. 
    
    (c) You may not rent, lease, lend or encumber Software. 
    
    (d) You do not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices 
    contained in the Software,
    
    (e) Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not 
    decompile, or reverse engineer Software. 
    
    (f) The terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to any Software
    updates, provided to you at Sun's discretion, that replace and/or 
    supplement the original Software, unless such update contains a separate
    license. 
    
    (g) Software is copyrighted. 
    
    (h) Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design, 
    construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility and Sun 
    and its licensors disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for 
    such uses. 
    
    (i) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, 
    logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this 
    Agreement. 
    
    (j) If your Permitted Use in this Agreement permits the distribution 
    Software or portions of the Software, you may only distribute the Software 
    subject to a license agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent 
    with the terms contained in this Agreement.
    
    4. Java Compatibility and Open Source.
    
    Software may contain Java technology.  You may not create additional 
    classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under 
    compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available 
    at www.java.net.
    
    Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source 
    developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and 
    open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its 
    products.
    
    Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and 
    open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern 
    the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not 
    alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source 
    licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of 
    liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in 
    this distribution.
    
    5. Term and Termination. 
    
    The Agreement is effective on the Date you recieve the Software and 
    remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement 
    will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially 
    breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its 
    licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should 
    any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, 
    the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade 
    secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and 
    destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1, 
    3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.
    
    6. Limited Warranty. 
    
    Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of 
    receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free 
    of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for 
    the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and 
    Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's 
    option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.  
    Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so 
    the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you 
    specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to 
    state.
    
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. 
    
    UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, 
    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT 
    ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO 
    BE LEGALLY INVALID. 
    
    8. Limitation of Liability. 
    
    TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
    LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, 
    INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED 
    REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE 
    USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
    whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
    the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
    limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
    essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental 
    or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be 
    applicable to you. 
    
    9. Export Regulations. 
    
    All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials 
    delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws 
    and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.  
    You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and 
    acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to 
    export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you. 
    
    10. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. 
    
    If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or 
    by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), 
    then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation 
    will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 
    48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) 
    acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions). 
    
    11. Governing Law. 
    
    Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law 
    and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any 
    jurisdiction will apply. 
    
    12. Severability. 
    
    If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this 
    Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
    omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this 
    Agreement will immediately terminate.
    
    13. Integration. 
    
    This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to 
    its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
    written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and 
    prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, 
    acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to 
    its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No modification 
    of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an 
    authorized representative of each party.

     The code here is based on code from Cryptlib 3.0 beta by Peter Gutmann.
    
       This module and the misc/rnd*.c modules represent the cryptlib
       continuously seeded pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) as described in
       my 1998 Usenix Security Symposium paper "The generation of random numbers
       for cryptographic purposes".
    
       The CSPRNG code is copyright Peter Gutmann (and various others) 1996,

     Modified by Wei Dai from Andrew M. Kuchling's md4.c
     The original code and all modifications are in the public domain.
    
     Distribute and use freely; there are no restrictions on further
     dissemination and usage except those imposed by the laws of your
     country of residence.
    
     Note: This code is heavily based on the GNU MP Library.
      Actually it's the same code with only minor changes in the
      way the data is stored; this is to support the abstraction
      of an optional secure memory allocation which may be used
      to avoid revealing of sensitive data due to paging etc.
     
     This random number generator is modelled after the one described in
     Peter Gutmann's paper: "Software Generation of Practically Strong
     Random Numbers". See also chapter 6 in his book "Cryptographic
     Security Architecture", New York, 2004, ISBN 0-387-95387-6.
     
     This implementation was written by Nikos Mavroyanopoulos for GNUTLS
     as a Libgcrypt module (gnutls/lib/x509/rc2.c) and later adapted for
     direct use by Libgcrypt by Werner Koch.  This implementation is
     only useful for pkcs#12 descryption.
    
     The implementation here is based on Peter Gutmann's RRC.2 paper.
     
     This code uses an algorithm protected by U.S. Patent #4,405,829
       which expired on September 20, 2000.  The patent holder placed that
       patent into the public domain on Sep 6th, 2000.
    For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice other
    than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, Sun elects to
    use only the General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) at this time
    for any software where a choice of GPL license versions is made
    available with the language indicating that GPLv2 or any later
    version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the GPL
    is applied is otherwise unspecified.

     The code here is based on code from Cryptlib 3.0 beta by Peter Gutmann.
    
       This module and the misc/rnd*.c modules represent the cryptlib
       continuously seeded pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) as described in
       my 1998 Usenix Security Symposium paper "The generation of random numbers
       for cryptographic purposes".
    
       The CSPRNG code is copyright Peter Gutmann (and various others) 1996,

     Modified by Wei Dai from Andrew M. Kuchling's md4.c
     The original code and all modifications are in the public domain.
    
     Distribute and use freely; there are no restrictions on further
     dissemination and usage except those imposed by the laws of your
     country of residence.
    
     Note: This code is heavily based on the GNU MP Library.
      Actually it's the same code with only minor changes in the
      way the data is stored; this is to support the abstraction
      of an optional secure memory allocation which may be used
      to avoid revealing of sensitive data due to paging etc.
     
     This random number generator is modelled after the one described in
     Peter Gutmann's paper: "Software Generation of Practically Strong
     Random Numbers". See also chapter 6 in his book "Cryptographic
     Security Architecture", New York, 2004, ISBN 0-387-95387-6.
     
     This implementation was written by Nikos Mavroyanopoulos for GNUTLS
     as a Libgcrypt module (gnutls/lib/x509/rc2.c) and later adapted for
     direct use by Libgcrypt by Werner Koch.  This implementation is
     only useful for pkcs#12 descryption.
    
     The implementation here is based on Peter Gutmann's RRC.2 paper.
     
     This code uses an algorithm protected by U.S. Patent #4,405,829
       which expired on September 20, 2000.  The patent holder placed that
       patent into the public domain on Sep 6th, 2000.

    Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following
    license(s):

    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    		       Version 2, June 1991
    
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                              59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA
                              02111-1307, USA.
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.
    
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
    
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
    Public License instead of this License.

    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
    
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
    
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
    
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    
    	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
    Public License instead of this License.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
               Version 2.1, February 1999
    
     Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]
    
              Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
    
      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
    these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    
      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
    introduced by others.
    
      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
    
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
    libraries into non-free programs.
    
      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
    the library.
    
      We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.
    
      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    
      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
    system.
    
      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
    that program using a modified version of the Library.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.
    
          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
      A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    
      The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    
      "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the library.
    
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
    and what the program that uses the Library does.
      
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.
    
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    
        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    
        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.
    
        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Library.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
    these notices.
    
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    
      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
    the Library into a program that is not a library.
    
      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.
    
      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    
      However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
    
      When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    
      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
    
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    
      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.
    
      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
    of these things:
    
        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)
    
        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    
        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.
    
        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.
    
        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
    
      For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
    the executable.
    
      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
    distribute.
    
      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    
        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.
    
        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.
    
      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
    this License.
    
      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    
      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.
    
              NO WARRANTY
    
      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
    
             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
    
      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
    ordinary General Public License).
    
      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
        version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    
        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
        Lesser General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
      library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    That's all there is to it!

          The source code of unRAR utility is freeware. This means:
    
       1. All copyrights to RAR and the utility unRAR are exclusively
          owned by the author - Alexander Roshal.
    
       2. The unRAR sources may be used in any software to handle RAR
          archives without limitations free of charge, but cannot be used
          to re-create the RAR compression algorithm, which is proprietary.
          Distribution of modified unRAR sources in separate form or as a
          part of other software is permitted, provided that it is clearly
          stated in the documentation and source comments that the code may
          not be used to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.
    
       3. The unRAR utility may be freely distributed. No person or company 
          may charge a fee for the distribution of unRAR without written
          permission from the copyright holder.
    
       4. THE RAR ARCHIVER AND THE UNRAR UTILITY ARE DISTRIBUTED "AS IS".
          NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND IS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  YOU USE AT 
          YOUR OWN RISK. THE AUTHOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DATA LOSS, 
          DAMAGES, LOSS OF PROFITS OR ANY OTHER KIND OF LOSS WHILE USING
          OR MISUSING THIS SOFTWARE.
    
       5. Installing and using the unRAR utility signifies acceptance of
          these terms and conditions of the license.
    
       6. If you don't agree with terms of the license you must remove
          unRAR files from your storage devices and cease to use the
          utility.
    
          Thank you for your interest in RAR and unRAR.

    or distribution of any and all Programs, Software, or Redistributables.
    
    3. Restrictions.
    
    (a) The copies of Software provided to you under this Agreement is
    licensed, not sold, to you by Sun.  Sun reserves all rights not expressly
    granted.
    
    (b) You may not modify Software.  However if the documentation
    accompanying Software lists specific portions of Software, such as header
    files, class libraries, reference source code, and/or redistributable
    files, that may be handled differently, you may do so only as provided in
    the documentation.
    
    (c) You may not rent, lease, lend or encumber Software.
    
    (d) You do not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices

    (f) The terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to any Software
    updates, provided to you at Sun's discretion, that replace and/or
    supplement the original Software, unless such update contains a separate
    license.
    
    (g) Software is copyrighted.
    
    (h) Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design,
    construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility and Sun

    Software or portions of the Software, you may only distribute the Software
    subject to a license agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent with
    the terms contained in this Agreement.
    
    4. Java Compatibility and Open Source.
    
    Software may contain Java technology.  You may not create additional
    classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under
    compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available
    at www.java.net.
    
    Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
    developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and
    open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its
    products.
    
    Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
    open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
    the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not
    alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source
    licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
    liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in
    this distribution.
    
    5. Term and Termination.
    
    The Agreement is effective on the Date you receive the Software and
    remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement
    will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially
    breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its
    licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should
    any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become,
    the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade
    secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and
    destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1,
    3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.
    
    6. Limited Warranty.
    
    Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
    receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free
    of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for
    the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and
    Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's
    option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.
    Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so
    the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you
    specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to
    state.
    
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    
    UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
    ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO
    BE LEGALLY INVALID.
    
    8. Limitation of Liability.
    
    TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
    LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
    REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
    USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you,
    whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
    the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing
    limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
    essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
    or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
    applicable to you.
    
    9. Export Regulations.
    
    All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials
    delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws
    and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
    You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and
    acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to
    export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.
    
    10. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.
    
    If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or
    by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
    then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation
    will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with
    48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
    acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).
    
    11. Governing Law.
    
    Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law
    and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any
    jurisdiction will apply.
    
    12. Severability.
    
    If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
    Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless
    omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
    Agreement will immediately terminate.
    
    13. Integration.
    
    This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to
    its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or
    written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and
    prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order,
    acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to
    its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No modification
    of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an
    authorized representative of each party.

    Common Public License Version 1.0
    
       THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
       PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
       THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
       
       1. DEFINITIONS 
       
       "Contribution" means:
       
         a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
         
         b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
         
         i) changes to the Program, and
         
         ii) additions to the Program;
         
         where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
         and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
         'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
         such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
         behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
         which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
         conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
         (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
         
       "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
       
       "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
       which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
       alone or when combined with the Program.
       
       "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
       Agreement.
       
       "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
       Agreement, including all Contributors.
       
       2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
       
         a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
         license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
         display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
         works, in source code and object code form.
         
         b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
         license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
         import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
         if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
         shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
         if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
         by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
         other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
         se is licensed hereunder.
         
         c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
         licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
         provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
         patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
         Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
         brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
         property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
         rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
         assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
         property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
         patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
         before distributing the Program.
         
         d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
         the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
         
       3. REQUIREMENTS
       
       A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
       under its own license agreement, provided that:
       
         a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
         
         b) its license agreement:
         
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
         warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
         particular purpose;
         
         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
         
         iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
         and
         
         iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
         exchange.
         
       When the Program is made available in source code form:
       
         a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
         
         b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
         Program.
         
       Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
       within the Program.
       
       Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
       Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
       Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
       
       4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
       
       Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
       responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
       like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
       of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
       commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
       create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
       Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
       such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
       and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
       against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
       from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
       against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
       or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
       distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
       obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
       relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
       In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
       notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
       Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
       negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
       claim at its own expense.
       
       For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
       product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
       Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
       claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
       claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
       alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
       defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
       performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
       Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
       must pay those damages.
       
       5. NO WARRANTY
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
       PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
       WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
       OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
       responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
       distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
       exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
       the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
       laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
       unavailability or interruption of operations.
       
       6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
       ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
       WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
       LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
       NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
       DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
       HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
       
       7. GENERAL
       
       If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
       the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
       action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
       
       If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
       respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
       counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
       Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
       of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
       institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
       itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
       hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
       rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
       litigation is filed.
       
       All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
       fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
       Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
       time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
       rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
       and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
       However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
       granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
       survive.
       
       Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
       but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
       may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
       reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
       this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
       Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
       Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
       Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
       the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
       Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
       the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
       after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
       elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
       the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
       above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
       property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
       by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
       expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
       
       This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
       the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
       party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
       more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
       its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

    Common Public License Version 1.0
    
       THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
       PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
       THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
       
       1. DEFINITIONS 
       
       "Contribution" means:
       
         a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
         
         b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
         
         i) changes to the Program, and
         
         ii) additions to the Program;
         
         where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
         and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
         'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
         such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
         behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
         which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
         conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
         (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
         
       "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
       
       "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
       which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
       alone or when combined with the Program.
       
       "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
       Agreement.
       
       "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
       Agreement, including all Contributors.
       
       2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
       
         a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
         license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
         display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
         works, in source code and object code form.
         
         b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
         license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
         import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
         if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
         shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
         if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
         by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
         other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
         se is licensed hereunder.
         
         c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
         licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
         provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
         patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
         Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
         brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
         property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
         rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
         assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
         property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
         patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
         before distributing the Program.
         
         d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
         the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
         
       3. REQUIREMENTS
       
       A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
       under its own license agreement, provided that:
       
         a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
         
         b) its license agreement:
         
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
         warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
         particular purpose;
         
         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
         
         iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
         and
         
         iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
         exchange.
         
       When the Program is made available in source code form:
       
         a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
         
         b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
         Program.
         
       Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
       within the Program.
       
       Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
       Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
       Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
       
       4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
       
       Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
       responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
       like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
       of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
       commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
       create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
       Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
       such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
       and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
       against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
       from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
       against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
       or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
       distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
       obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
       relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
       In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
       notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
       Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
       negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
       claim at its own expense.
       
       For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
       product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
       Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
       claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
       claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
       alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
       defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
       performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
       Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
       must pay those damages.
       
       5. NO WARRANTY
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
       PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
       WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
       OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
       responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
       distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
       exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
       the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
       laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
       unavailability or interruption of operations.
       
       6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
       ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
       WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
       LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
       NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
       DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
       HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
       
       7. GENERAL
       
       If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
       the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
       action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
       
       If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
       respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
       counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
       Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
       of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
       institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
       itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
       hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
       rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
       litigation is filed.
       
       All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
       fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
       Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
       time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
       rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
       and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
       However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
       granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
       survive.
       
       Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
       but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
       may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
       reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
       this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
       Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
       Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
       Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
       the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
       Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
       the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
       after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
       elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
       the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
       above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
       property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
       by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
       expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
       
       This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
       the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
       party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
       more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
       its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

    The "Artistic License"
      Preamble
        The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
        Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
        semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while
        giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the
        Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
        reasonable modifications.
    
      Definitions
        "Package"
            refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
            Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through
            textual modification.
    
        "Standard Version"
            refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been
            modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as
            specified below.
    
        "Copyright Holder"
            is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
    
        "You"
            is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
            Package.
    
        "Reasonable copying fee"
            is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
            charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
            required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the
            computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
    
        "Freely Available"
            means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may
            be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
            of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
            received it.
    
      Conditions
        1.  You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
            Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
            you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
            disclaimers.
    
        2.  You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
            derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A
            Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
            Standard Version.
    
        3.  You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
            provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
            stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
            at least ONE of the following:
    
            a)  place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
                them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
                Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on
                a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the
                Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard
                Version of the Package.
    
            b)  use the modified Package only within your corporation or
                organization.
    
            c)  rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
                with standard executables, which must also be provided, and
                provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable
                that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
    
            d)  make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
    
        4.  You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
            executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
    
            a)  distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
                files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
                equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
    
            b)  accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
                the Package with your modifications.
    
            c)  give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
                document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),
                together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
    
            d)  make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
    
        5.  You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
            Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
            Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
            you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
            commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
            software distribution provided that you do not advertise this
            Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's
            interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall
            be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the
            complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.
    
        6.  The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
            output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
            under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
            them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
            Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
            Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing
            a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
            neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
            fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you
            do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of
            this Package.
    
        7.  C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
            languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
            emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
            Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
            equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
            not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
            regression tests for the language.
    
        8.  Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
            permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that
            is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces
            visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use
            shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
    
        9.  The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
            promote products derived from this software without specific prior
            written permission.
    
        10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
            WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
            MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

    *3. Distribution Obligations.*
    
        * 3.1 Application of License. The Modifications which You create or
          to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
          including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version
          of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this
          License or a future version of this License released under Section
          6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
          of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
          terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
          applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
          hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
          offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
        * 3.2 Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create
          or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code
          form under the terms of this License either on the same media as
          an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
          Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
          available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
          Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months
          after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
          months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
          has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible
          for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even
          if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third
          party.
        * 3.3 Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code
          to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes
          You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change.
          You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
          derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by
          the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
          Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
          Executable version or related documentation in which You describe
          the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
        * 3.4 Intellectual Property Matters.
              o (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has actual knowledge
                that a license under a third party's intellectual property
                rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
                Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must
                include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
                "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the
                claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
                to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
                Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
                Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
                copies Contributor makes available thereafter.
              o (b) Contributor API's. If Contributor's Modifications
                include an application programming interface and Contributor
                has actual knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
                necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
                include this information in the LEGAL file.
              o (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
                disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor
                believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's
                original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
                rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
        * 3.5 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in *Exhibit A*
          in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such
          notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then
          You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
          directory) where a user would be most likely to look for such a
          notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add
          your name as a Contributor to the notice described in *Exhibit A.
          *You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
          Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
          rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
          charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
          obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
          You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
          Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
          clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
          obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
          indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
          liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual
          property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the
          Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
          support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
        * 3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute
          Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
          Section* 3.1-3.5 *have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
          include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
          Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
          including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
          obligation of Section *3.2.* The notice must be conspicuously
          included in any notice in an Executable version, related
          documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
          rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
          Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a
          license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
          this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
          of this License and that the license for the Executable version
          does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
          Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If
          You distribute the Executable version under a different license
          You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
          this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
          Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
          Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
          (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property claims
          relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or
          such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
        * 3.7 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining
          Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this
          License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
          such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
          are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
    
    *4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.* If it is
    impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
    respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
    License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations
    and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
    file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
    distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
    statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
    for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
    
    *5. Application of this License.* This License applies to code to which
    the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to
    related Covered Code.
    
    *6. Versions of the License.*
    
        * 6.1 New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry Association (the
          "SNIA") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
          from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
          version number.
        * 6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published
          under a particular version of the License, You may always continue
          to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to
          use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of
          the License published by the SNIA. No one other than the SNIA has
          the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
          under this License.
        * 6.3 Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of
          this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code
          which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You
          must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Storage
          Networking Industry Association," "SNIA," or any confusingly
          similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
          your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
          clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ
          from the SNIA Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
          Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
          Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
          this License.)
    
    *7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE
    ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE
    IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
    RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
    THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
    DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO
    USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
    DISCLAIMER.*
    
    *8. TERMINATION.*
    
        * *8.1 *This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
          automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
          cure such breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware of
          the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly
          granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
          which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
          termination of this License shall survive.
        * *8.2* If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
          infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions)
          against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer
          or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
          "Participant") alleging that:
              o *(a)* such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
                indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
                granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
                2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
                Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
                days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in
                writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
                royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made
                by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim
                with respect to the Contributor Version against such
                Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable
                royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon
                in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
                withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
                Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the
                expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
        * *8.3* If You assert a patent infringement claim against
          Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
          directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
          resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
          initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
          value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
          2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount
          or value of any payment or license.
    
           
    
        * *8.4* In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
          all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and
          resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
          distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
    
    *9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL
    THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
    SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
    DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
    LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
    MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
    SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
    PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
    APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
    ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.*
    
    *10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.* The Covered Code is a "commercial
    item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),
    consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer
    software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
    (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
    through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire
    Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
    
    *11. MISCELLANEOUS *This License represents the complete agreement
    concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
    held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
    extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
    by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
    application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
    International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
    which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
    against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
    
    *12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.* As between Initial Developer and the
    Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
    directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
    License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is
    intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
    
    *13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.* Initial Developer may designate portions
    of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means
    that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the
    Covered Code under Your choice of this License or the alternative
    licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file
    described in Exhibit A.
    
    *14. ACCEPTANCE.* This License is accepted by You if You retain, use, or
    distribute the Covered Code for any purpose.

                Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
                subject to third party intellectual property claims, the
                Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,
                royalty-free, non-exclusive license: 
    
                      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
                      patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer,
                      to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
                      sublicense and distribute the Original Software (or

                Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
                subject to third party intellectual property claims, each
                Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
                non-exclusive license:

                      (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,
                      using, or selling of Modifications made by that
                      Contributor either alone and/or in combination with
                      its Contributor Version (or portions of such
                      combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
                      have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1)
                      Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions
                      thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications
                      made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version
                      (or portions of such combination). 
    
                      (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and
                      2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first
                      distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications
                      available to a third party. 
    
                      (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent
                      license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor
                      has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for
                      infringements caused by: (i) third party
                      modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the
                      combination of Modifications made by that Contributor
                      with other software (except as part of the
                      Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under
                      Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the
                      absence of Modifications made by that Contributor. 
    
          3. Distribution Obligations.
    
                3.1. Availability of Source Code.
    
                Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
                available in Executable form must also be made available in
                Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
                distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
                include a copy of this License with every copy of the
                Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
                otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
                such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
                obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
                reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
                for software exchange.
    
                3.2. Modifications.
    
                The Modifications that You create or to which You
                contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
                represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
                original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
                grant the rights conveyed by this License.
    
                3.3. Required Notices.
    
                You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
                that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.
                You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
                trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
                any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
                attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
    
                3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
    
                You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
                Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
                applicable version of this License or the recipients'
                rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
                fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
                However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
                behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
                must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
                support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
                You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
                Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
                by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
              
    
                3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
    
                You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
                Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
                of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
                different from this License, provided that You are in
                compliance with the terms of this License and that the
                license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
                or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
                from the rights set forth in this License. If You
                distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
                different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
                any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
                alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You
                hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
                Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
                Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
                You offer.
    
                3.6. Larger Works.
    
                You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
                with other code not governed by the terms of this License
                and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
                a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
                are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 
                
          4. Versions of the License. 
    
                4.1. New Versions.
    
                Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
                may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
                from time to time. Each version will be given a
                distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
                Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
                right to modify this License. 
    
                4.2. Effect of New Versions.
    
                You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
                make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
                version of the License under which You originally received
                the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
                notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
                distributed or otherwise made available under any
                subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
                make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
                version of the License under which You originally received
                the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
                use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
                available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
                License published by the license steward. 
    
                4.3. Modified Versions.
    
                When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
                new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
                use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
                the license and remove any references to the name of the
                license steward (except to note that the license differs
                from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
                the license contains terms which differ from this License.
                
    
          5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
    
          COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
          BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
          INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
          SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
          PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
          COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
          INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
          ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
          WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
          ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
          DISCLAIMER. 
    
          6. TERMINATION. 
    
                6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
                terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
                herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
                becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
                nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
                this License shall survive.
    
                6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
                declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
                a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
                whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
                alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
                Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
                or the Original Software where the Participant is the
                Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
                patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
                indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
                Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
                and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
                License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
                terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
                of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
                period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
                Participant Software against such Participant either
                unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
                Participant.
    
                6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
                above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
                by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
                (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
                shall survive termination.
    
          7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
    
          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
          (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
          INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
          COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
          LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
          CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
          LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
          STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
          COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
          INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
          LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
          INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
          APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
          NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
          CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
          APPLY TO YOU.
    
          8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
    
          The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
          defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
          computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
          252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
          documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
          1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
          through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
          acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
          This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
          any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
          Government rights in computer software under this License.
    
          9. MISCELLANEOUS.
    
          This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
          matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
          unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
          extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
          governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
          contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
          applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
          jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
          relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
          the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
          notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
          party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
          costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
          application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
          International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
          regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
          be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
          You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
          United States export administration regulations (and the export
          control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
          distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    
          10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
    
          As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
          responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
          indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
          and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
          distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
          herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
          of liability.

     Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
     modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are
     met:
    
     1. Redistributions in source code must retain the above copyright

     2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
        notice, this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer in
        the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
        distribution.
    
     3. Digital Creations requests that attribution be given to Zope
        in any manner possible. Zope includes a "Powered by Zope"
        button that is installed by default. While it is not a license
        violation to remove this button, it is requested that the
        attribution remain. A significant investment has been put
        into Zope, and this effort will continue if the Zope community
        continues to grow. This is one way to assure that growth.
    
     4. All advertising materials and documentation mentioning
        features derived from or use of this software must display
        the following acknowledgement:
    
          "This product includes software developed by Digital Creations
          for use in the Z Object Publishing Environment
          (http://www.zope.org/)."
    
        In the event that the product being advertised includes an
        intact Zope distribution (with copyright and license included)
        then this clause is waived.
    
     5. Names associated with Zope or Digital Creations must not be used to
        endorse or promote products derived from this software without
        prior written permission from Digital Creations.
    
     6. Modified redistributions of any form whatsoever must retain
        the following acknowledgment:
    
          "This product includes software developed by Digital Creations
          for use in the Z Object Publishing Environment
          (http://www.zope.org/)."
    
        Intact (re-)distributions of any official Zope release do not
        require an external acknowledgement.
    
     7. Modifications are encouraged but must be packaged separately as
        patches to official Zope releases.  Distributions that do not
        clearly separate the patches from the original work must be clearly
        labeled as unofficial distributions.  Modifications which do not
        carry the name Zope may be packaged in any form, as long as they
        conform to all of the clauses above.

    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    		       Version 2, June 1991
    
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                              59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA
                              02111-1307, USA.
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.
    
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free

    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED

      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING

    	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author

        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
    Public License instead of this License.
    For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice other
    than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, Sun elects to
    use only the General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) at this time
    for any software where a choice of GPL license versions is made

    version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the GPL
    is applied is otherwise unspecified.

    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    		       Version 2, June 1991
    
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                              59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA
                              02111-1307, USA.
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.
    
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
    
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

     Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]
    
                                Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
    
      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
    below.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
    these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    
      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
    introduced by others.
    ^L
      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
    
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
    libraries into non-free programs.
    
      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
    the library.
    
      We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.
    
      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
    becomes
    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    
      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
    system.
    
      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
    that program using a modified version of the Library.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.
    ^L
                      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
      A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    
      The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    
      "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
    compilation
    and installation of the library.
    
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
    and what the program that uses the Library does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.
    
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    
        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    
        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.
    
        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Library.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
    these notices.
    ^L
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    
      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
    the Library into a program that is not a library.
    
      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.
    
      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    
      However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
    
      When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    
      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
    
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    ^L
      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.
    
      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
    of these things:
    
        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)
    
        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    
        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.
    
        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.
    
        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
    
      For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
    the executable.
    
      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
    distribute.
    ^L
      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    
        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.
    
        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.
    
      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
    this License.
    ^L
      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    ^L
      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.
    
                                NO WARRANTY
    
      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
    
                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    ^L
               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
    
      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
    of the ordinary General Public License).
    
      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
    It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
    effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
    have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
    notice is found.
    
    
        &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it
    does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
        version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    
        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
        Lesser General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
    mail.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
    your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
      library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
    Random Hacker.

      Ty Coon, President of Vice

    copyright owner that is granting the License.
    
    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other
    entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
    with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means
    (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
    of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of
    fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
    beneficial ownership of such entity.
    
    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
    permissions granted by this License.
    
    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.
    
    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not
    limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
    conversions to other media types.
    
    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
    form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
    notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is
    provided in the Appendix below).
    
    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
    
    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the
    original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that
    Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to
    Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an
    individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the
    copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means
    any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
    Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
    
    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
    behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
    
    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly
    display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
    Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
    
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
    in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
    sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
    applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
    are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
    combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
    Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
    against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
    lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
    the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
    any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
    shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
    
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
    or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
    following conditions:
    
       1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative
       Works a copy of this License; and
    
       2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and
    
       3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that
       You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
       notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
       that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
    
       4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within
       such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
       part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
       places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
       Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
       provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
       generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
       notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
       informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
       add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
       distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
       Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
       construed as modifying the License.
    
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
    in this License.
    
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
    You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
    License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
    separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
    regarding such Contributions.
    
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
    
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
    to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
    provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
    CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
    limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
    redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
    exercise of permissions under this License.
    
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
    required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
    acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
    for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
    License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
    not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
    losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility
    of such damages.
    
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
    fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
    accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
    Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
    only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
    harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
    such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
    additional liability.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.
    
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
    
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
    Public License instead of this License.

    Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by
    Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
    
    3. Distribution Obligations.
    
    3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute
    or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available
    in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only
    under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License
    with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You
    distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of
    any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain
    such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
    through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
    
    3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to which You
    contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that
    You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
    have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
    
    3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of
    Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the
    Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
    trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices
    of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor
    or the Initial Developer.
    
    3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or impose
    any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or
    restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights
    hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
    of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must
    make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
    incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
    
    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the
    Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License
    or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with
    the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form
    does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source
    Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
    the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license,
    You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
    or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
    
    3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
    Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License
    and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
    You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
    the Covered Software.
    
    4. Versions of the License.
    
    4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward
    and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
    time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except
    as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has
    the right to modify this License.
    
    4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, distribute
    or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
    the version of the License under which You originally received the
    Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the
    Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise
    made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
    distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
    version of the License under which You originally received the Covered
    Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise
    make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent
    version of the License published by the license steward.
    
    4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You want
    to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
    use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
    and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
    note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make
    it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
    
    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS
    LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
    SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
    OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
    OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
    CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
    CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
    OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
    EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
    
    6. TERMINATION.
    
    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
    such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
    which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
    this License shall survive.
    
    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
    judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
    Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim
    is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software
    (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
    or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
    granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
    Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
    Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
    days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such
    60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
    Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a
    written agreement with Participant.
    
    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
    user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
    hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by
    any distributor) shall survive termination.
    
    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL
    THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
    YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
    PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
    ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS,
    LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR
    ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
    HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION
    OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
    OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a commercial item,
    as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting
    of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as
    such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
    C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
    all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
    rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu
    of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
    that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.
    
    9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement
    concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License
    is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only
    to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
    governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law
    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to
    the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue
    specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with
    the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation,
    court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application
    of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
    of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
    the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
    not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for
    compliance with the United States export administration regulations
    (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
    when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    
    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the
    Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
    directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
    License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors
    to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein
    is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
    
    NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION
    LICENSE (CDDL) The code released under the CDDL shall be governed
    by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law
    provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
    to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
    California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue
    lying in Santa Clara County, California.

    Copyright (C) 1999-2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
    
                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007
    
     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
                                Preamble
    
      The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
    software and other kinds of works.
    
      The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
    to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
    software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
    any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
    freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
    or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
    know their rights.
    
      Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
    (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
    
      For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
    that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
    authors of previous versions.
    
      Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
    can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
    protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
    products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
    
      Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
    make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
      0. Definitions.
    
      "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
    
      "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
    works, such as semiconductor masks.
    
      "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
    "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
    
      To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
    exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
    earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
    
      A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program.
    
      To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
    computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
    public, and in some countries other activities as well.
    
      To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
    a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
    
      An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
    
      1. Source Code.
    
      The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
    form of a work.
    
      A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
    is widely used among developers working in that language.
    
      The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
    Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
    implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
    "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
    (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
    produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
    
      The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
    which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
    includes interface definition files associated with source files for
    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
    linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
    subprograms and other parts of the work.
    
      The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
    Source.
    
      The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
    same work.
    
      2. Basic Permissions.
    
      All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
    conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
    permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
    covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
    content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
    rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
    
      You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
    in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
    of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
    with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
    not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
    for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
    your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
    
      Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
    the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
    makes it unnecessary.
    
      3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
    
      No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
    11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
    similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
    measures.
    
      When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
    is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
    the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
    modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
    users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
    technological measures.
    
      4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
    
      You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
    keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
    keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
    recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
    
      You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
    and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
    
      5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
    
      You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
    produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
    terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
        it, and giving a relevant date.
    
        b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
        released under this License and any conditions added under section
        7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
        "keep intact all notices".
    
        c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
        License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
        License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
        additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
        regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
        permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
        invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    
        d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
        Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
        interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
        work need not make them do so.
    
      A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
    works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
    and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
    in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
    "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
    used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
    beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
    in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
    parts of the aggregate.
    
      6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
    
      You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
    machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
    in one of these ways:
    
        a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
        Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
        customarily used for software interchange.
    
        b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
        written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
        long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
        model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
        copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
        product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
        medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
        more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
        conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
        Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    
        c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
        written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
        alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
        only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
        with subsection 6b.
    
        d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
        place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
        Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
        further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
        Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
        copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
        may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
        that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
        clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
        Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
        Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
        available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    
        e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
        you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
        Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
        charge under subsection 6d.
    
      A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
    from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
    included in conveying the object code work.
    
      A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
    or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
    into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
    doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
    product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
    typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
    of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
    actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
    is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
    commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
    the only significant mode of use of the product.
    
      "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
    procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
    and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
    a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
    suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
    code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
    modification has been made.
    
      If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
    specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
    part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
    User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
    fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
    Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
    by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
    if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
    modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
    been installed in ROM).
    
      The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
    requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
    for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
    the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
    network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
    adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
    protocols for communication across the network.
    
      Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
    in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
    documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
    source code form), and must require no special password or key for
    unpacking, reading or copying.
    
      7. Additional Terms.
    
      "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
    Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
    be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
    that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
    apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
    under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
    this License without regard to the additional permissions.
    
      When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
    remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
    it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
    removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
    additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
    for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
    
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
    add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
    that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
    
        a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
        terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    
        b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
        author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
        Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    
        c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
        requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
        reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    
        d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
        authors of the material; or
    
        e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
        trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    
        f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
        material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
        it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
        any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
        those licensors and authors.
    
      All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
    restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
    governed by this License along with a term that is a further
    restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
    a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
    License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
    of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
    not survive such relicensing or conveying.
    
      If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
    must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
    additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
    where to find the applicable terms.
    
      Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
    form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
    the above requirements apply either way.
    
      8. Termination.
    
      You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
    provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
    modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
    this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
    paragraph of section 11).
    
      However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
    holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
    prior to 60 days after the cessation.
    
      Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
    your receipt of the notice.
    
      Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
    material under section 10.
    
      9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
    
      You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
    run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
    occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
    to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
    nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
    modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
    not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
    covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
    
      10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
    
      Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
    propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
    for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
    
      An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
    organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
    work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
    transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
    licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
    give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
    Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
    the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
    
      You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
    rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
    not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
    rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
    sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
    
      11. Patents.
    
      A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
    License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
    work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
    
      A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
    owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
    by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
    but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
    consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
    purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
    patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
    this License.
    
      Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
    patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
    make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
    propagate the contents of its contributor version.
    
      In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
    (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
    sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
    party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
    patent against the party.
    
      If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
    and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
    to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
    publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
    then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
    available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
    patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
    license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
    actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
    covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
    in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
    country that you have reason to believe are valid.
    
      If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
    arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
    covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
    receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
    or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
    you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
    work and works based on it.
    
      A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
    the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
    specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
    work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
    in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
    to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
    the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
    parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
    patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
    conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
    for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
    or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
    
      Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
    any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
    otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
    
      12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
    
      If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
    not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
    the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
    License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
    
      13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
    
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
    permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
    under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
    combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
    License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
    but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
    section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
    combination as such.
    
      14. Revised Versions of this License.
    
      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
    the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
    Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
    Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
    option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
    version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
    GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
    by the Free Software Foundation.
    
      If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
    versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
    public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
    to choose that version for the Program.
    
      Later license versions may give you additional or different
    permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
    author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
    later version.
    
      15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    
      THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
    THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
    IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      16. Limitation of Liability.
    
      IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.
    
      17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
    
      If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
    an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
    Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
    copy of the Program in return for a fee.
    
                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
      If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
    notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
    might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

      Copyright 1995-1996 by Fred L. Drake, Jr. and Virginia Polytechnic
      Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA.
      Portions copyright 1991-1995 by Stichting Mathematisch Centrum,
      Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  Copying is permitted under the terms
      associated with the main Python distribution, with the additional
      restriction that this additional notice be included and maintained
      on all distributed copies.
    
      This module serves to replace the original parser module written
      by Guido.  The functionality is not matched precisely, but the
      original may be implemented on top of this.  This is desirable
      since the source of the text to be parsed is now divorced from
      this interface.
    
      Unlike the prior interface, the ability to give a parse tree
      produced by Python code as a tuple to the compiler is enabled by
      this module.  See the documentation for more details.
    
      I've added some annotations that help with the lint code-checking
      program, but they're not complete by a long shot.  The real errors
      that lint detects are gone, but there are still warnings with
      Py_[X]DECREF() and Py_[X]INCREF() macros.  The lint annotations
      look like "NOTE(...)".

     Ported to Think C: 19 Jan 1992 guido@cwi.nl
    
     This code draws many ideas from the regular expression packages by
     Henry Spencer of the University of Toronto and Richard Stallman of
     the Free Software Foundation.
    
     Emacs-specific code and syntax table code is almost directly borrowed
     from GNU regexp.
    
     Bugs fixed and lots of reorganization by Jeffrey C. Ollie, April
     1997 Thanks for bug reports and ideas from Andrew Kuchling, Tim
     Peters, Guido van Rossum, Ka-Ping Yee, Sjoerd Mullender, and
     probably one or two others that I'm forgetting.

    Python-2.4.4/Modules/_randommodule.c:
    
     Random objects 
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
       The code in this module was based on a download from:
    	  http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/MT2002/emt19937ar.html
    
       It was modified in 2002 by Raymond Hettinger as follows:
    
    	* the principal computational lines untouched except for tabbing.
    
    	* renamed genrand_res53() to random_random() and wrapped
    	  in python calling/return code.
    
    	* genrand_int32() and the helper functions, init_genrand()
    	  and init_by_array(), were declared static, wrapped in
    	  Python calling/return code.  also, their global data
    	  references were replaced with structure references.
    
    	* unused functions from the original were deleted.
    	  new, original C python code was added to implement the
    	  Random() interface.
    
       The following are the verbatim comments from the original code:
    
       A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.
       Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
    
       Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
       or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).

      Copyright 1995-1996 by Fred L. Drake, Jr. and Virginia Polytechnic

      restriction that this additional notice be included and maintained

      This module serves to replace the original parser module written
      by Guido.  The functionality is not matched precisely, but the
      original may be implemented on top of this.  This is desirable
      since the source of the text to be parsed is now divorced from
      this interface.
    
      Unlike the prior interface, the ability to give a parse tree
      produced by Python code as a tuple to the compiler is enabled by
      this module.  See the documentation for more details.
    
      I've added some annotations that help with the lint code-checking
      program, but they're not complete by a long shot.  The real errors
      that lint detects are gone, but there are still warnings with
      Py_[X]DECREF() and Py_[X]INCREF() macros.  The lint annotations
      look like "NOTE(...)".

     Ported to Think C: 19 Jan 1992 guido@cwi.nl
    
     This code draws many ideas from the regular expression packages by
     Henry Spencer of the University of Toronto and Richard Stallman of
     the Free Software Foundation.
    
     Emacs-specific code and syntax table code is almost directly borrowed
     from GNU regexp.
    
     Bugs fixed and lots of reorganization by Jeffrey C. Ollie, April
     1997 Thanks for bug reports and ideas from Andrew Kuchling, Tim
     Peters, Guido van Rossum, Ka-Ping Yee, Sjoerd Mullender, and
     probably one or two others that I'm forgetting.

    Python-2.4.4/Modules/_randommodule.c:
    
     Random objects 
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
       The code in this module was based on a download from:
    	  http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/MT2002/emt19937ar.html
    
       It was modified in 2002 by Raymond Hettinger as follows:
    
    	* the principal computational lines untouched except for tabbing.
    
    	* renamed genrand_res53() to random_random() and wrapped
    	  in python calling/return code.
    
    	* genrand_int32() and the helper functions, init_genrand()
    	  and init_by_array(), were declared static, wrapped in
    	  Python calling/return code.  also, their global data
    	  references were replaced with structure references.
    
    	* unused functions from the original were deleted.
    	  new, original C python code was added to implement the
    	  Random() interface.
    
       The following are the verbatim comments from the original code:
    
       A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.
       Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
    
       Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
       or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).

    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    		       Version 2, June 1991
    
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.
    
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
    
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
    Public License instead of this License.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    
    0. PREAMBLE
    
    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
    the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
    modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
    this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
    credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
    modifications made by others.
    
    This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
    
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
    whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
    
    
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
    
    This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
    under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
    such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
    addressed as "you".
    
    A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
    
    A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
    the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.
    
    The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License.
    
    The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
    the Document is released under this License.
    
    A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
    to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
    format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
    not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
    or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
    HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
    PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
    by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
    purposes only.
    
    The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    
    
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
    
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
    copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
    you may publicly display copies.
    
    
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
    
    If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
    and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
    the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
    the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
    you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
    visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
    as verbatim copying in other respects.
    
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.
    
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
    a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
    general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
    option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
    Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
    until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
    copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
    the public.
    
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
    
    
    4. MODIFICATIONS
    
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
    of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
       Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
       Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
       Modified Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
       and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
       unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
       or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
       may not be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
       or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
    
    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
    of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    
    You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
    
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
    through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
    
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
    
    
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
    
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
    license notice.
    
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
    copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
    
    In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
    in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
    "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
    and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
    entitled "Endorsements."
    
    
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
    
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
    
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
    other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
    
    
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
    of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
    compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
    License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
    with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
    are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
    
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
    of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
    covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
    Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
    
    
    8. TRANSLATION
    
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
    original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
    translation of this License provided that you also include the
    original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
    between the translation and the original English version of this
    License, the original English version will prevail.
    
    
    9. TERMINATION
    
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
    as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
    copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
    parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
    License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
    
    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
    
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
    of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
    
    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
    License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version

    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
    
    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
    the License in the document and put the following copyright and
    license notices just after the title page:
    
          Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
          Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
          under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
          or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
          with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
          Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
          A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
          Free Documentation License".
    
    If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
    instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
    Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
    
    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
    free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
    to permit their use in free software.

        UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.
    
    8. Limitation of Liability.
    
        TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable to you.
    
    9. Export Regulations.
    
        All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

    13. Integration.
    
        This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.

    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    		       Version 2, June 1991
    
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.
    
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
    
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
    Public License instead of this License.

64)  The following software may be included in this product:

	GNU diffutils (SUNWgnu-diffutils)

    Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following
    license(s):

    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    		       Version 2, June 1991
    
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.
    
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
    
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
    Public License instead of this License.

    Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following
    license(s):

    for any software where a choice of GPL license versions is made
    available with the language indicating that GPLv2 or any later
    version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the GPL
    is applied is otherwise unspecified.

    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    
    Version 2, June 1991
    
    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
    
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    Preamble
    
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
    to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
    License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
    
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
    new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
    for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
    must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And
    you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
    we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,
    so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
    only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
    of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
    on what the Program does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
        under the terms of this License.
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
        run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
        use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
        including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there
        is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
        that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
        telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if
        the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
        an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to
        print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
    then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
    you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
    permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
    each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
    the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
    based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.
    
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
        to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
        physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
        copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
        terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
        software interchange; or,
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
        accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception,
    the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
    distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
    (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
    executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
    copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the
    source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
    source along with the object code.
    
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
    full compliance.
    
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
    it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
    the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
    by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
    distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate
    your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
    for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
    
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
    
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
    and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
    claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
    the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public
    license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
    wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
    decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
    to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software
    and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    NO WARRANTY
    
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
    AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
    LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]
    
    Preamble
    
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
    to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users.
    
    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
    designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
    Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too,
    but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or
    the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in
    any particular case, based on the explanations below.
    
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in
    new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
    
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    
    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete
    object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the
    library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you
    must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    
    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
    is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified
    by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
    have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation
    will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
    
    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively
    restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license
    from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license
    obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full
    freedom of use specified in this license.
    
    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
    GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General
    Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite
    different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license
    for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into
    non-free programs.
    
    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
    shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined
    work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public
    License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination
    fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits
    more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
    
    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.
    
    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage
    the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a
    de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed
    to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does
    the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there
    is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only,
    so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    
    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
    software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
    programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,
    as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
    
    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked
    with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
    using a modified version of the Library.
    
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.
    
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
    which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
    party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
    Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
    "you".
    
    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared
    so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use
    some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    
    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
    has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library"
    means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either
    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into
    another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
    in the term "modification".)
    
    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the
    source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the library.
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
    program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing
    it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the
    program that uses the Library does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  * b) You
        must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files and the date of any change.  * c) You
        must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
        third parties under the terms of this License.  * d) If a facility
        in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to
        be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
        than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must
        make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
        does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
        and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
    
          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of
          the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function must
          be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
          root function must still compute square roots.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
    then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
    you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
    permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
    each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
    the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
    based on the Library.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.
    
    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
    they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead
    of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary
    GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version
    instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
    
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
    copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent
    copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    
    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
    Library into a program that is not a library.
    
    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
    it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
    corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
    for software interchange.
    
    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from
    a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
    code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
    source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
    source along with the object code.
    
    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
    but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with
    it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation,
    is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside
    the scope of this License.
    
    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates
    an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
    portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The
    executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms
    for distribution of such executables.
    
    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that
    is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative
    work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this
    is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the
    Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to
    be true is not precisely defined by law.
    
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
    layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
    lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted,
    regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
    containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall
    under Section 6.)
    
    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
    the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
    containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
    linked directly with the Library itself.
    
    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
    containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
    of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work
    for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such
    modifications.
    
    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
    execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright
    notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the
    user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
    
        * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
        use the modified definitions.)  * b) Use a suitable shared library
        mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one
        that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on
        the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions
        into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
        version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
        modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
        work was made with.  * c) Accompany the work with a written offer,
        valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost
        of performing this distribution.  * d) If distribution of the work
        is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer
        equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the
        same place.  * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy
        of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
    
    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"
    must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
    executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to
    be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
    (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
    kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
    unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
    
    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions
    of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the
    operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them
    and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
    
    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
    side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities
    not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
    provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library
    and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided
    that you do these two things:
    
        * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
        on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This
        must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  * b)
        Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
        part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
        find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
    Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
    Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
    this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
    from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
    long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
    it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
    the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
    by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
    distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate
    your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
    for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
    
    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
    licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
    
    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
    and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Library.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
    claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity
    of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public
    license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
    wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
    decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
    will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
    detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
    version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
    Software Foundation.
    
    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write
    to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
    by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
    we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    NO WARRANTY
    
    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
    AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
    LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
    LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
    
    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
    the ordinary General Public License).
    
    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
    one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
    Copyright (C) year  name of author
    
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
    under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published
    by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
    
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY
    or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public
    License for more details.
    
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License
    along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
    Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
    your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
    if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library
    `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
    
    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of Vice

    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
    the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
    modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
    this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
    credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
    modifications made by others.
    
    This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
    
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does.	But this License is not limited to software manuals;
    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
    whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
    
    
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
    
    This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
    under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
    such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
    addressed as "you".
    
    A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
    
    A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
    the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.
    
    The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License.
    
    The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
    the Document is released under this License.
    
    A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
    to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
    format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.	A copy that is
    not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
    or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
    HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
    PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
    by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
    purposes only.
    
    The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    
    
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
    
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
    copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
    you may publicly display copies.
    
    
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
    
    If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
    and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
    the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
    the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
    you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
    visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
    as verbatim copying in other respects.
    
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.
    
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
    a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
    general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
    option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
    Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
    until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
    copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
    the public.
    
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
    
    
    4. MODIFICATIONS
    
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
    of it.	In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
       Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
       Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
       Modified Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
       and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
       unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
       or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".	Such a section
       may not be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
       or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
    
    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
    of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    
    You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
    
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
    through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
    
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
    
    
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
    
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
    license notice.
    
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
    copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
    
    In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
    in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
    "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
    and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
    entitled "Endorsements."
    
    
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
    
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
    
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
    other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
    
    
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
    of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
    compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
    License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
    with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
    are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
    
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
    of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
    covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
    Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
    
    
    8. TRANSLATION
    
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
    original versions of these Invariant Sections.	You may include a
    translation of this License provided that you also include the
    original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
    between the translation and the original English version of this
    License, the original English version will prevail.
    
    
    9. TERMINATION
    
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
    as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
    copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
    parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
    License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
    
    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
    
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
    of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
    
    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
    License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
    as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    
    
    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
    
    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
    the License in the document and put the following copyright and
    license notices just after the title page:
    
          Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
          Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
          document
          under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
          or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
          with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
          Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
          being LIST.
          A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
          Free Documentation License".
    
    If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
    instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
    Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
    
    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
    free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
    to permit their use in free software.

         51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    
    0. PREAMBLE
    
    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
    Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
    to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
    for modifications made by others.
    
    This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
    
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does.	But this License is not limited to software manuals;
    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
    whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
    
    
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
    
    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
    work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
    refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
    licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
    under copyright law.
    
    A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
    
    A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
    the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.
    
    The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
    section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
    allowed to be designated as Invariant.	The Document may contain zero
    Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
    Sections then there are none.
    
    The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
    the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
    
    A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
    to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
    format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
    or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
    An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
    of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
    or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
    HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
    transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
    include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
    proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.
    
    The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    
    A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
    title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
    text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
    specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
    of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
    section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
    
    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
    states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
    License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
    implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
    no effect on the meaning of this License.
    
    
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
    
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
    copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
    you may publicly display copies.
    
    
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
    
    If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
    the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
    you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
    visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
    as verbatim copying in other respects.
    
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.
    
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
    a computer-network location from which the general network-using
    public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
    a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
    If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
    when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
    that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
    Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
    edition to the public.
    
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
    
    
    4. MODIFICATIONS
    
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
    of it.	In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
       Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
       Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
       unless they release you from this requirement.
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
       Modified Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
       and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
       to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
       there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
       the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
       unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
       or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".	Such a section
       may not be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
       or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
    O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
    
    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
    of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    
    You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
    
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
    through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
    
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
    
    
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
    
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
    license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
    
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
    copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
    
    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
    "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
    and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
    Entitled "Endorsements".
    
    
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
    
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
    
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
    other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
    
    
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
    of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
    When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
    apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.
    
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
    the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
    covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
    electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
    Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
    aggregate.
    
    
    8. TRANSLATION
    
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
    original versions of these Invariant Sections.	You may include a
    translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
    Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
    the original English version of this License and the original versions
    of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
    the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
    or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
    
    If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
    its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
    title.
    
    
    9. TERMINATION
    
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
    as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
    copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
    parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
    License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
    
    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
    
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
    of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
    
    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
    License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
    as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    
    
    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
    
    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
    the License in the document and put the following copyright and
    license notices just after the title page:
    
        Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
        Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
        under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
        or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
        with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
        Texts.
        A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
        Free Documentation License".
    
    If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
    replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
    
        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
        LIST.
    
    If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
    combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
    situation.
    
    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
    free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
    to permit their use in free software.

    arising out of the use of or inability to use this software.
    
    Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
    including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
    freely, subject to the above disclaimer and the following restrictions:
    
        1. Redistributions of source code (in whole or in part) must retain
           the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list
           of conditions.
    
        2. Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries)
           must reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer,
           and this list of conditions in documentation and/or other materials
           provided with the distribution.  The sole exception to this condition
           is redistribution of a standard UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as
           part of a self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion
           of this license, as long as the normal SFX banner has not been removed
           from the binary or disabled.
    
        3. Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating
           systems, existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with
           modified or added functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library
           versions not from Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not
           be misrepresented as being the original source or, if binaries,
           compiled from the original source.  Such altered versions also must not
           be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP releases--including, but not
           limited to, labeling of the altered versions with the names "Info-ZIP"
           (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to, different
           capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
           explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions are further
           prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP
           e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
           will provide support for the altered versions.
    
        4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
           "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its
           own source and binary releases.

    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    
    Version 2, June 1991
    
    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
    
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    Preamble
    
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
    to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
    License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
    
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
    new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
    for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
    must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And
    you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
    we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,
    so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
    only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
    of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
    on what the Program does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
        under the terms of this License.
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
        run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
        use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
        including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there
        is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
        that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
        telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if
        the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
        an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to
        print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
    then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
    you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
    permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
    each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
    the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
    based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.
    
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
        to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
        physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
        copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
        terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
        software interchange; or,
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
        accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception,
    the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
    distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
    (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
    executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
    copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the
    source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
    source along with the object code.
    
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
    full compliance.
    
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
    it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
    the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
    by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
    distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate
    your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
    for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
    
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
    
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
    and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
    claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
    the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public
    license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
    wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
    decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
    to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software
    and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    NO WARRANTY
    
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
    AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
    LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    
    Version 2.1, February 1999
    
    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  51 Franklin
    Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Everyone is permitted
    to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
    changing it is not allowed.
    
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]
    
    Preamble
    
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
    to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users.
    
    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
    designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
    Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too,
    but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or
    the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in
    any particular case, based on the explanations below.
    
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in
    new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
    
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    
    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete
    object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the
    library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you
    must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    
    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
    is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified
    by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
    have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation
    will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
    
    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively
    restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license
    from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license
    obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full
    freedom of use specified in this license.
    
    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
    GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General
    Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite
    different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license
    for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into
    non-free programs.
    
    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
    shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined
    work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public
    License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination
    fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits
    more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
    
    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.
    
    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage
    the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a
    de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed
    to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does
    the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there
    is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only,
    so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    
    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
    software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
    programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,
    as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
    
    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked
    with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
    using a modified version of the Library.
    
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.
    
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
    which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
    party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
    Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
    "you".
    
    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared
    so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use
    some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    
    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
    has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library"
    means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either
    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into
    another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
    in the term "modification".)
    
    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the
    source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the library.
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
    program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing
    it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the
    program that uses the Library does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  * b) You
        must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files and the date of any change.  * c) You
        must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
        third parties under the terms of this License.  * d) If a facility
        in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to
        be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
        than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must
        make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
        does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
        and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
    
          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of
          the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function must
          be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
          root function must still compute square roots.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
    then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
    you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
    permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
    each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
    the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
    based on the Library.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.
    
    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
    they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead
    of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary
    GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version
    instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
    
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
    copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent
    copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    
    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
    Library into a program that is not a library.
    
    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
    it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
    corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
    for software interchange.
    
    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from
    a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
    code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
    source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
    source along with the object code.
    
    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
    but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with
    it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation,
    is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside
    the scope of this License.
    
    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates
    an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
    portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The
    executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms
    for distribution of such executables.
    
    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that
    is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative
    work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this
    is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the
    Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to
    be true is not precisely defined by law.
    
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
    layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
    lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted,
    regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
    containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall
    under Section 6.)
    
    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
    the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
    containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
    linked directly with the Library itself.
    
    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
    containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
    of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work
    for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such
    modifications.
    
    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
    execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright
    notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the
    user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
    
        * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
        use the modified definitions.)  * b) Use a suitable shared library
        mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one
        that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on
        the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions
        into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
        version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
        modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
        work was made with.  * c) Accompany the work with a written offer,
        valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost
        of performing this distribution.  * d) If distribution of the work
        is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer
        equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the
        same place.  * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy
        of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
    
    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"
    must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
    executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to
    be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
    (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
    kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
    unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
    
    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions
    of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the
    operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them
    and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
    
    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
    side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities
    not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
    provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library
    and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided
    that you do these two things:
    
        * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
        on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This
        must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  * b)
        Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
        part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
        find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
    Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
    Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
    this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
    from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
    long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
    it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
    the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
    by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
    distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate
    your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
    for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
    
    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
    licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
    
    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
    and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Library.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
    claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity
    of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public
    license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
    wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
    decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
    will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
    detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
    version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
    Software Foundation.
    
    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write
    to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
    by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
    we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    NO WARRANTY
    
    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
    AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
    LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
    LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
    
    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
    the ordinary General Public License).
    
    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
    one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
    Copyright (C) year  name of author
    
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
    under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published
    by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
    
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY
    or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public
    License for more details.
    
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License
    along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
    Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
    your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
    if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library
    `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
    
    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    That's all there is to it!

    		GNU Free Documentation License
    		   Version 1.1, March 2000
    
     Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    
    0. PREAMBLE
    
    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
    the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
    modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
    this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
    credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
    modifications made by others.
    
    This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
    
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does.	But this License is not limited to software manuals;
    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
    whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
    
    
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
    
    This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
    under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
    such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
    addressed as "you".
    
    A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
    
    A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
    the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.
    
    The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License.
    
    The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
    the Document is released under this License.
    
    A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
    to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
    format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.	A copy that is
    not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
    or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
    HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
    PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
    by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
    purposes only.
    
    The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    
    
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
    
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
    copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
    you may publicly display copies.
    
    
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
    
    If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
    and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
    the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
    the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
    you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
    visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
    as verbatim copying in other respects.
    
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.
    
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
    a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
    general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
    option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
    Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
    until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
    copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
    the public.
    
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
    
    
    4. MODIFICATIONS
    
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
    of it.	In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
       Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
       Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
       Modified Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
       and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
       unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
       or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".	Such a section
       may not be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
       or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
    
    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
    of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    
    You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
    
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
    through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
    
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
    
    
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
    
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
    license notice.
    
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
    copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
    
    In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
    in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
    "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
    and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
    entitled "Endorsements."
    
    
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
    
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
    
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
    other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
    
    
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
    of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
    compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
    License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
    with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
    are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
    
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
    of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
    covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
    Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
    
    
    8. TRANSLATION
    
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
    original versions of these Invariant Sections.	You may include a
    translation of this License provided that you also include the
    original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
    between the translation and the original English version of this
    License, the original English version will prevail.
    
    
    9. TERMINATION
    
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
    as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
    copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
    parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
    License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
    
    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
    
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
    of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
    
    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
    License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
    as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    
    
    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
    
    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
    the License in the document and put the following copyright and
    license notices just after the title page:
    
          Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
          Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
          document
          under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
          or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
          with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
          Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
          being LIST.
          A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
          Free Documentation License".
    
    If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
    instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
    Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
    
    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
    free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
    to permit their use in free software.
    
    ========================================================================
    
    		GNU Free Documentation License
    		  Version 1.2, November 2002
    
    
     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    
    0. PREAMBLE
    
    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
    Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
    to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
    for modifications made by others.
    
    This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
    
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does.	But this License is not limited to software manuals;
    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
    whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
    
    
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
    
    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
    work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
    refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
    licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
    under copyright law.
    
    A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
    
    A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
    the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.
    
    The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
    section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
    allowed to be designated as Invariant.	The Document may contain zero
    Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
    Sections then there are none.
    
    The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
    the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
    
    A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
    to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
    format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
    or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
    An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
    of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
    or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
    HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
    transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
    include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
    proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.
    
    The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    
    A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
    title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
    text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
    specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
    of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
    section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
    
    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
    states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
    License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
    implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
    no effect on the meaning of this License.
    
    
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
    
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
    copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
    you may publicly display copies.
    
    
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
    
    If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
    the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
    you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
    visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
    as verbatim copying in other respects.
    
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.
    
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
    a computer-network location from which the general network-using
    public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
    a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
    If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
    when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
    that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
    Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
    edition to the public.
    
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
    
    
    4. MODIFICATIONS
    
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
    of it.	In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
       Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
       Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
       unless they release you from this requirement.
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
       Modified Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
       and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
       to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
       there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
       the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
       unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
       or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".	Such a section
       may not be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
       or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
    O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
    
    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
    of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    
    You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
    
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
    through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
    
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
    
    
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
    
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
    license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
    
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
    copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
    
    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
    "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
    and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
    Entitled "Endorsements".
    
    
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
    
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
    
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
    other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
    
    
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
    of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
    When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
    apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.
    
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
    the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
    covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
    electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
    Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
    aggregate.
    
    
    8. TRANSLATION
    
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
    original versions of these Invariant Sections.	You may include a
    translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
    Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
    the original English version of this License and the original versions
    of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
    the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
    or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
    
    If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
    its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
    title.
    
    
    9. TERMINATION
    
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
    as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
    copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
    parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
    License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
    
    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
    
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
    of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
    
    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
    License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not

    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
    
    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
    the License in the document and put the following copyright and
    license notices just after the title page:
    
        Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
        Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
        under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
        or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
        with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
        Texts.
        A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
        Free Documentation License".
    
    If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
    replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
    
        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
        LIST.
    
    If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
    combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
    situation.
    
    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
    free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
    to permit their use in free software.

    For the purposes of this copyright and license, "Info-ZIP" is defined as
    the following set of individuals:

    Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
    including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
    freely, subject to the above disclaimer and the following restrictions:
    
        1. Redistributions of source code (in whole or in part) must retain
           the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list
           of conditions.
    
        2. Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries)
           must reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer,
           and this list of conditions in documentation and/or other materials
           provided with the distribution.  The sole exception to this condition
           is redistribution of a standard UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as
           part of a self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion
           of this license, as long as the normal SFX banner has not been removed
           from the binary or disabled.
    
        3. Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating
           systems, existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with
           modified or added functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library
           versions not from Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not
           be misrepresented as being the original source or, if binaries,
           compiled from the original source.  Such altered versions also must not
           be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP releases--including, but not
           limited to, labeling of the altered versions with the names "Info-ZIP"
           (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to, different
           capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
           explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions are further
           prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP
           e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
           will provide support for the altered versions.
    
        4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
           "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its
           own source and binary releases.

    This license applies to all portions of Subversion which are not

    their terms may differ from the terms below.
    
    This is version 1 of this license.  It is also available online at

    this license are posted there (the same URL, but with the version
    number incremented: .../license-2.html, .../license-3.html, and so
    on), you may use a newer version instead, at your option.

    thereof), with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger
    Work; and
    
    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of

     date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes the Original
     Software available to a third party under the terms of this License;
    
     (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted:
     (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or (2) for
     infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the Original Software,
     or (ii) the combination of the Original Software with other software
     or devices.
    
    2.2. Contributor Grant. Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section
    3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual property claims, each
    Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
    license:
    
    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
    sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor
    (or portions thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other
    Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
    
    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
    Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination
    with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make,
    use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of:
    (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and

    Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
    
    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective
    on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the
    Modifications available to a third party.
    
    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted:
    (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor
    Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications
    of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by
    that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor
    Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by
    Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
    
    3. Distribution Obligations.
    
    3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute
    or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available
    in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only
    under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License
    with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You
    distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of
    any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain
    such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
    through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
    
    3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to which You
    contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that
    You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
    have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
    
    3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of
    Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the
    Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
    trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices
    of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor
    or the Initial Developer.
    
    3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or impose
    any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or
    restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights
    hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
    of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must
    make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
    incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
    
    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the
    Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License
    or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with
    the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form
    does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source
    Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
    the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license,
    You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
    or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
    
    3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
    Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License
    and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
    You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
    the Covered Software.
    
    4. Versions of the License.
    
    4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward
    and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
    time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except
    as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has
    the right to modify this License.
    
    4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, distribute
    or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
    the version of the License under which You originally received the
    Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the
    Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise
    made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
    distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
    version of the License under which You originally received the Covered
    Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise
    make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent
    version of the License published by the license steward.
    
    4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You want
    to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
    use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
    and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
    note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make
    it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
    
    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS
    LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
    SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
    OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
    OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
    CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
    CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
    OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
    EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
    
    6. TERMINATION.
    
    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
    such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
    which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
    this License shall survive.
    
    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
    judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
    Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim
    is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software
    (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
    or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
    granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
    Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
    Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
    days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such
    60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
    Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a
    written agreement with Participant.
    
    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
    user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
    hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by
    any distributor) shall survive termination.
    
    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL
    THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
    YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
    PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
    ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS,
    LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR
    ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
    HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION
    OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
    OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a commercial item,
    as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting
    of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as
    such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
    C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
    all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
    rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu
    of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
    that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.
    
    9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement
    concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License
    is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only
    to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
    governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law
    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to
    the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue
    specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with
    the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation,
    court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application
    of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
    of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
    the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
    not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for
    compliance with the United States export administration regulations
    (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
    when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    
    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the
    Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
    directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
    License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors
    to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein
    is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
    
    NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION
    LICENSE (CDDL) The code released under the CDDL shall be governed
    by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law
    provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject

    5. Term and Termination.
    
        The Agreement is effective on the Date you receive the Software and remians effective until terminated.

    4. Java Compatibility and Open Source.

    compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available 
    at www.java.net.
    
    Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source 
    developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and 
    open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its 
    products.
    
    Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and 
    open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern 
    the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not 
    alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source 
    licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of 
    liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in 
    this distribution.
    
    5. Term and Termination. 
    
    The Agreement is effective on the Date you recieve the Software and 
    remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement 
    will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially 
    breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its 
    licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should 
    any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, 
    the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade 
    secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and 
    destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1, 
    3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.
    
    6. Limited Warranty. 
    
    Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of 
    receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free 
    of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for 
    the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and 
    Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's 
    option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.  
    Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so 
    the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you 
    specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to 
    state.
    
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. 
    
    UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, 
    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT 
    ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO 
    BE LEGALLY INVALID. 
    
    8. Limitation of Liability. 
    
    TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
    LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, 
    INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED 
    REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE 
    USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
    whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
    the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
    limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
    essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental 
    or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be 
    applicable to you. 
    
    9. Export Regulations. 
    
    All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials 
    delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws 
    and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.  
    You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and 
    acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to 
    export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you. 
    
    10. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. 
    
    If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or 
    by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), 
    then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation 
    will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 
    48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) 
    acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions). 
    
    11. Governing Law. 
    
    Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law 
    and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any 
    jurisdiction will apply. 
    
    12. Severability. 
    
    If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this 
    Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
    omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this 
    Agreement will immediately terminate.
    
    13. Integration. 
    
    This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to 
    its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
    written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and 
    prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, 
    acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to 
    its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No modification 
    of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an 
    authorized representative of each party.

        Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
        the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of this
        License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
        Software You distribute or otherwise make available.  You must

        form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
        used for software exchange.
    
        3.2. Modifications.
    
        The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
        governed by the terms of this License.  You represent that You
        believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
        You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
        License.
    
        3.3. Required Notices.
    
        You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
        identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may
        not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
        contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
        or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
        the Initial Developer.
    
        3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
    
        You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
        Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
        of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  You may
        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
        Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
        You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
        hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
        Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
        such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
        liability terms You offer.
    
        3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
    
        You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
        under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
        Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
        and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
        limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
        the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the
        Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
        must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
        this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
        Developer or Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the
        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
        such terms You offer.
    
        3.6. Larger Works.
    
        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
        other code not governed by the terms of this License and
        distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case,
        You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
        for the Covered Software.
    
    4. Versions of the License.
    
        4.1. New Versions.
    
        Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
        publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
        time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
        Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
        steward has the right to modify this License.
    
        4.2. Effect of New Versions.
    
        You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
        Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
        License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
        If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
        Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
        available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
        distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
        of the version of the License under which You originally received
        the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
        distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
        the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
        the license steward.
    
        4.3. Modified Versions.
    
        When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
        license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
        modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
        and remove any references to the name of the license steward
        (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
        (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
        differ from this License.

        PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY
        COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
        NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF
        WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF
        ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
        DISCLAIMER.
    
    6. TERMINATION.
    
        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
        cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
        Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
        the termination of this License shall survive.
    
        6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
        declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
        Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
        assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
        the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
        the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
        the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
        infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
        indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
        the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
        under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
        notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
        at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
        such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
        Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
        or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
    
        6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
        all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
        distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
        granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
    
    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
    
        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
        COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
        LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
        STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
        COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
        INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF
        LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
        INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
        APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
        NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU.
    
    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
    
        The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
        defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
        computer software" (as that term is defined at 48
        C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
        documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
        (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
        C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
        U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
        rights set forth herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
        lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
        provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
        under this License.
    
    9. MISCELLANEOUS.
    
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
        matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable.  This License shall be governed
        by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
        within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
        if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
        conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this
        License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
        in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
        within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
        for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
        reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the
        United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
        of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which
        provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
        against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  You agree
        that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
        States export administration regulations (and the export control
        laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
        distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    
    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
    
        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
        responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
        indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
        and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
        distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing
        herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
        of liability.
    
    NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND
    DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
    
    For Covered Software in this distribution, this License shall
    be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding
    conflict-of-law provisions).
    
    Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
    jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
    California and the state courts of the State of California, with
    venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

    		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    		       Version 2.1, February 1999
    
     Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
    
      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
    these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    
      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
    introduced by others.
    
      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
    
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
    libraries into non-free programs.
    
      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
    the library.
    
      We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.
    
      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    
      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
    system.
    
      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
    that program using a modified version of the Library.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.
    
    		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
      A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    
      The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    
      "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the library.
    
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
    and what the program that uses the Library does.
      
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.
    
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    
        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    
        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.
    
        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Library.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
    these notices.
    
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    
      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
    the Library into a program that is not a library.
    
      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.
    
      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    
      However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
    
      When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    
      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
    
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    
      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.
    
      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
    of these things:
    
        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)
    
        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    
        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.
    
        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.
    
        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
    
      For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
    the executable.
    
      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
    distribute.
    
      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    
        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.
    
        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.
    
      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
    this License.
    
      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    
      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
    
      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
    ordinary General Public License).
    
      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
        version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    
        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
        Lesser General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
      library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    That's all there is to it!

        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
        Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
        You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
        hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
        Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
        such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
        liability terms You offer.
    
        3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
    
        You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
        under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
        Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
        and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
        limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
        the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the
        Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
        must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
        this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
        Developer or Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the
        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
        such terms You offer.
    
        3.6. Larger Works.
    
        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
        other code not governed by the terms of this License and
        distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case,
        You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
        for the Covered Software.
    
    4. Versions of the License.
    
        4.1. New Versions.
    
        Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
        publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
        time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
        Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
        steward has the right to modify this License.
    
        4.2. Effect of New Versions.
    
        You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
        Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
        License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
        If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
        Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
        available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
        distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
        of the version of the License under which You originally received
        the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
        distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
        the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
        the license steward.
    
        4.3. Modified Versions.
    
        When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
        license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
        modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
        and remove any references to the name of the license steward
        (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
        (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
        differ from this License.
    
    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
    
        COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
        BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
        SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY
        COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
        NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF
        WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF
        ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
        DISCLAIMER.
    
    6. TERMINATION.
    
        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
        cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
        Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
        the termination of this License shall survive.
    
        6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
        declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
        Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
        assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
        the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
        the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
        the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
        infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
        indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
        the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
        under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
        notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
        at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
        such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
        Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
        or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
    
        6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
        all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
        distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
        granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
    
    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
    
        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
        COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
        LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
        STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
        COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
        INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF
        LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
        INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
        APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
        NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU.
    
    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
    
        The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
        defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
        computer software" (as that term is defined at 48
        C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
        documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
        (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
        C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
        U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
        rights set forth herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
        lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
        provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
        under this License.
    
    9. MISCELLANEOUS.
    
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
        matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable.  This License shall be governed
        by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
        within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
        if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
        conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this
        License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
        in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
        within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
        for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
        reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the
        United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
        of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which
        provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
        against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  You agree
        that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
        States export administration regulations (and the export control
        laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
        distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    
    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
    
        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
        responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
        indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
        and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
        distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing
        herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
        of liability.
    
    NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND
    DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
    
    For Covered Software in this distribution, this License shall
    be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding
    conflict-of-law provisions).
    
    Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
    jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
    California and the state courts of the State of California, with
    venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

     Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
    
      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
    these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    
      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
    introduced by others.
    
      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
    
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
    libraries into non-free programs.
    
      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
    the library.
    
      We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.
    
      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    
      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
    system.
    
      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
    that program using a modified version of the Library.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.
    
    		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
      A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    
      The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    
      "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the library.
    
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
    and what the program that uses the Library does.
      
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.
    
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    
        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    
        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.
    
        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Library.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
    these notices.
    
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    
      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
    the Library into a program that is not a library.
    
      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.
    
      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    
      However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
    
      When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    
      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
    
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    
      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.
    
      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
    of these things:
    
        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)
    
        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    
        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.
    
        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.
    
        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
    
      For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
    the executable.
    
      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
    distribute.
    
      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    
        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.
    
        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.
    
      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
    this License.
    
      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    
      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.

    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
    
      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
    ordinary General Public License).
    
      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
        version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    
        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
        Lesser General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
      library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    That's all there is to it!

    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    
    Version 2, June 1991
    
    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
    
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    Preamble
    
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
    to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
    License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
    
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
    new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
    for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
    must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And
    you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
    we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,
    so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
    only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
    of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
    on what the Program does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
        under the terms of this License.
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
        run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
        use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
        including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there
        is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
        that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
        telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if
        the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
        an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to
        print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
    then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
    you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
    permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
    each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
    the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
    based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.
    
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
        to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
        physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
        copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
        terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
        software interchange; or,
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
        accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception,
    the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
    distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
    (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
    executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
    copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the
    source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
    source along with the object code.
    
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
    full compliance.
    
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
    it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
    the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
    by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
    distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate
    your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
    for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
    
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
    
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
    and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
    claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
    the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public
    license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
    wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
    decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
    to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software
    and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    NO WARRANTY
    
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
    AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
    LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice other 
    than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, Sun elects to 
    use only the Lesser General Public License version 2.1 (LGPLv2) at 
    this time for any software where a choice of LGPL license versions 
    is made available with the language indicating that LGPLv2.1 or any 
    later version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the 
    LGPL is applied is otherwise unspecified.

    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    
    Version 2.1, February 1999
    
    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  51 Franklin
    Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Everyone is permitted
    to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
    changing it is not allowed.
    
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]
    
    Preamble
    
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
    to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users.
    
    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
    designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
    Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too,
    but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or
    the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in
    any particular case, based on the explanations below.
    
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in
    new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
    
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    
    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete
    object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the
    library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you
    must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    
    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
    is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified
    by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
    have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation
    will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
    
    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively
    restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license
    from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license
    obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full
    freedom of use specified in this license.
    
    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
    GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General
    Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite
    different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license
    for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into
    non-free programs.
    
    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
    shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined
    work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public
    License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination
    fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits
    more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
    
    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.
    
    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage
    the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a
    de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed
    to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does
    the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there
    is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only,
    so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    
    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
    software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
    programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,
    as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
    
    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked
    with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
    using a modified version of the Library.
    
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.
    
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
    which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
    party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
    Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
    "you".
    
    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared
    so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use
    some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    
    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
    has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library"
    means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either
    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into
    another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
    in the term "modification".)
    
    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the
    source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the library.
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
    program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing
    it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the
    program that uses the Library does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  * b) You
        must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files and the date of any change.  * c) You
        must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
        third parties under the terms of this License.  * d) If a facility
        in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to
        be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
        than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must
        make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
        does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
        and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
    
          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of
          the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function must
          be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
          root function must still compute square roots.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
    then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
    you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
    permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
    each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
    the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
    based on the Library.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.
    
    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
    they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead
    of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary
    GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version
    instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
    
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
    copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent
    copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    
    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
    Library into a program that is not a library.
    
    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
    it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
    corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
    for software interchange.
    
    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from
    a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
    code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
    source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
    source along with the object code.
    
    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
    but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with
    it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation,
    is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside
    the scope of this License.
    
    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates
    an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
    portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The
    executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms
    for distribution of such executables.
    
    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that
    is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative
    work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this
    is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the
    Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to
    be true is not precisely defined by law.
    
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
    layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
    lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted,
    regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
    containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall
    under Section 6.)
    
    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
    the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
    containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
    linked directly with the Library itself.
    
    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
    containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
    of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work
    for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such
    modifications.
    
    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
    execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright
    notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the
    user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
    
        * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
        use the modified definitions.)  * b) Use a suitable shared library
        mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one
        that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on
        the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions
        into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
        version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
        modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
        work was made with.  * c) Accompany the work with a written offer,
        valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost
        of performing this distribution.  * d) If distribution of the work
        is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer
        equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the
        same place.  * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy
        of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
    
    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"
    must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
    executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to
    be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
    (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
    kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
    unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
    
    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions
    of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the
    operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them
    and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
    
    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
    side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities
    not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
    provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library
    and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided
    that you do these two things:
    
        * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
        on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This
        must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  * b)
        Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
        part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
        find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
    Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
    Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
    this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
    from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
    long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
    it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
    the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
    by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
    distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate
    your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
    for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
    
    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
    licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
    
    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
    and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Library.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
    claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity
    of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public
    license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
    wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
    decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
    will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
    detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
    version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
    Software Foundation.
    
    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write
    to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
    by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
    we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    NO WARRANTY
    
    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
    AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
    LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
    LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
    
    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
    the ordinary General Public License).
    
    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
    one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
    Copyright (C) year  name of author
    
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
    under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published
    by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
    
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY
    or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public
    License for more details.
    
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License
    along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
    Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
    your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
    if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library
    `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
    
    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    That's all there is to it!

    for any software where a choice of GPL license versions is made
    available with the language indicating that GPLv2 or any later
    version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the GPL
    is applied is otherwise unspecified.

    Sun Microsystems, Inc. Binary Code License Agreement
    
    SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. ("SUN") IS WILLING TO LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO YOU
    ONLY UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED IN
    THIS BINARY CODE LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT").  PLEASE READ THE

    against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or
    expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim,
    lawsuit or action by any third party that arises or results from the use
    or distribution of any and all Programs, Software, or Redistributables.
    
    3. Restrictions.
    
    (a) The copies of Software provided to you under this Agreement is
    licensed, not sold, to you by Sun.  Sun reserves all rights not expressly
    granted.
    
    (b) You may not modify Software.  However if the documentation
    accompanying Software lists specific portions of Software, such as header
    files, class libraries, reference source code, and/or redistributable
    files, that may be handled differently, you may do so only as provided in
    the documentation.
    
    (c) You may not rent, lease, lend or encumber Software.
    
    (d) You do not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices
    contained in the Software,

    (f) The terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to any Software
    updates, provided to you at Sun's discretion, that replace and/or
    supplement the original Software, unless such update contains a separate
    license.
    
    (g) Software is copyrighted.
    
    (h) Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design,
    construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility and Sun
    and its licensors disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for
    such uses.
    
    (i) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark,
    logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this
    Agreement.
    
    (j) If your Permitted Use in this Agreement permits the distribution
    Software or portions of the Software, you may only distribute the Software
    subject to a license agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent with
    the terms contained in this Agreement.
    
    4. Java Compatibility and Open Source.
    
    Software may contain Java technology.  You may not create additional
    classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under
    compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available
    at www.java.net.
    
    Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
    developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and
    open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its
    products.
    
    Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
    open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
    the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not
    alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source
    licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
    liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in
    this distribution.
    
    5. Term and Termination.
    
    The Agreement is effective on the Date you receive the Software and
    remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement
    will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially
    breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its
    licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should
    any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become,
    the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade
    secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and
    destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1,
    3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.
    
    6. Limited Warranty.
    
    Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
    receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free
    of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for
    the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and
    Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's
    option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.
    Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so
    the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you
    specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to
    state.
    
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    
    UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
    ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO
    BE LEGALLY INVALID.
    
    8. Limitation of Liability.
    
    TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
    LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
    REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
    USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you,
    whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
    the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing
    limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
    essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
    or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
    applicable to you.
    
    9. Export Regulations.
    
    All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials
    delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws
    and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
    You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and
    acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to
    export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.
    
    10. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.
    
    If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or
    by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
    then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation
    will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with
    48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
    acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).
    
    11. Governing Law.
    
    Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law
    and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any
    jurisdiction will apply.
    
    12. Severability.
    
    If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
    Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless
    omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
    Agreement will immediately terminate.
    
    13. Integration.
    
    This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to
    its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or
    written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and
    prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order,
    acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to
    its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No modification
    of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an
    authorized representative of each party.

    5. Term and Termination.
    
        The Agreement is effective on the Date you receive the Software and remians effective until terminated.

        Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    
        UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

        TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable to you.
    
    9. Export Regulations.
    
        All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

    13. Integration.
    
        This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.

    5. Term and Termination. 
    
    The Agreement is effective on the Date you recieve the Software and

    Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's 
    option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.  
    Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so 
    the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you 
    specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to 
    state.
    
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

    USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
    whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
    the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
    limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
    essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental

    delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws

    Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless

    Agreement will immediately terminate.
    
    13. Integration. 
    
    This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to 
    its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or

                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007
    
     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
                                Preamble
    
      The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
    software and other kinds of works.
    
      The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
    to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
    software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
    any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
    freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
    or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
    know their rights.
    
      Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
    (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
    
      For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
    that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
    authors of previous versions.
    
      Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
    can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
    protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
    products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
    
      Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
    make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
      0. Definitions.
    
      "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
    
      "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
    works, such as semiconductor masks.
    
      "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
    "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
    
      To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
    exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
    earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
    
      A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program.
    
      To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
    computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
    public, and in some countries other activities as well.
    
      To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
    a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
    
      An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
    
      1. Source Code.
    
      The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
    form of a work.
    
      A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
    is widely used among developers working in that language.
    
      The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
    Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
    implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
    "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
    (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
    produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
    
      The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
    which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
    includes interface definition files associated with source files for
    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
    linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
    subprograms and other parts of the work.
    
      The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
    Source.
    
      The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
    same work.
    
      2. Basic Permissions.
    
      All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
    conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
    permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
    covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
    content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
    rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
    
      You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
    in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
    of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
    with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
    not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
    for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
    your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
    
      Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
    the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
    makes it unnecessary.
    
      3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
    
      No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
    11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
    similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
    measures.
    
      When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
    is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
    the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
    modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
    users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
    technological measures.
    
      4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
    
      You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
    keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
    keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
    recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
    
      You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
    and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
    
      5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
    
      You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
    produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
    terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
        it, and giving a relevant date.
    
        b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
        released under this License and any conditions added under section
        7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
        "keep intact all notices".
    
        c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
        License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
        License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
        additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
        regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
        permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
        invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    
        d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
        Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
        interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
        work need not make them do so.
    
      A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
    works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
    and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
    in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
    "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
    used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
    beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
    in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
    parts of the aggregate.
    
      6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
    
      You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
    machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
    in one of these ways:
    
        a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
        Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
        customarily used for software interchange.
    
        b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
        written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
        long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
        model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
        copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
        product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
        medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
        more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
        conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
        Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    
        c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
        written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
        alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
        only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
        with subsection 6b.
    
        d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
        place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
        Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
        further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
        Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
        copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
        may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
        that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
        clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
        Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
        Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
        available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    
        e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
        you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
        Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
        charge under subsection 6d.
    
      A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
    from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
    included in conveying the object code work.
    
      A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
    or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
    into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
    doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
    product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
    typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
    of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
    actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
    is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
    commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
    the only significant mode of use of the product.
    
      "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
    procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
    and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
    a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
    suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
    code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
    modification has been made.
    
      If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
    specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
    part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
    User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
    fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
    Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
    by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
    if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
    modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
    been installed in ROM).
    
      The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
    requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
    for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
    the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
    network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
    adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
    protocols for communication across the network.
    
      Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
    in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
    documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
    source code form), and must require no special password or key for
    unpacking, reading or copying.
    
      7. Additional Terms.
    
      "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
    Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
    be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
    that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
    apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
    under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
    this License without regard to the additional permissions.
    
      When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
    remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
    it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
    removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
    additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
    for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
    
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
    add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
    that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
    
        a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
        terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    
        b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
        author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
        Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    
        c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
        requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
        reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    
        d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
        authors of the material; or
    
        e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
        trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    
        f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
        material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
        it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
        any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
        those licensors and authors.
    
      All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
    restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
    governed by this License along with a term that is a further
    restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
    a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
    License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
    of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
    not survive such relicensing or conveying.
    
      If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
    must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
    additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
    where to find the applicable terms.
    
      Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
    form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
    the above requirements apply either way.
    
      8. Termination.
    
      You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
    provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
    modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
    this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
    paragraph of section 11).
    
      However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
    holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
    prior to 60 days after the cessation.
    
      Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
    your receipt of the notice.
    
      Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
    material under section 10.
    
      9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
    
      You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
    run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
    occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
    to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
    nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
    modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
    not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
    covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
    
      10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
    
      Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
    propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
    for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
    
      An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
    organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
    work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
    transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
    licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
    give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
    Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
    the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
    
      You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
    rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
    not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
    rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
    sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
    
      11. Patents.
    
      A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
    License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
    work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
    
      A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
    owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
    by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
    but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
    consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
    purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
    patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
    this License.
    
      Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
    patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
    make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
    propagate the contents of its contributor version.
    
      In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
    (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
    sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
    party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
    patent against the party.
    
      If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
    and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
    to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
    publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
    then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
    available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
    patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
    license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
    actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
    covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
    in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
    country that you have reason to believe are valid.
    
      If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
    arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
    covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
    receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
    or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
    you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
    work and works based on it.
    
      A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
    the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
    specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
    work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
    in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
    to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
    the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
    parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
    patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
    conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
    for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
    or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
    
      Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
    any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
    otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
    
      12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
    
      If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
    not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
    the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
    License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
    
      13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
    
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
    permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
    under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
    combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
    License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
    but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
    section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
    combination as such.
    
      14. Revised Versions of this License.
    
      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
    the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
    Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
    Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
    option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
    version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
    GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
    by the Free Software Foundation.
    
      If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
    versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
    public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
    to choose that version for the Program.
    
      Later license versions may give you additional or different
    permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
    author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
    later version.
    
      15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    
      THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
    THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
    IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      16. Limitation of Liability.
    
      IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.
    
      17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
    
      If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
    an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
    Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
    copy of the Program in return for a fee.
    
                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
      If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
    notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
    might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
    
      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
    if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
    For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
    &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
    
      The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
    into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
    the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
    Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
    &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

    		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    		       Version 2.1, February 1999
    
     Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
    
      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
    these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    
      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
    introduced by others.
    
      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
    
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
    libraries into non-free programs.
    
      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
    the library.
    
      We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.
    
      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    
      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
    system.
    
      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
    that program using a modified version of the Library.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.
    
    		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
      A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    
      The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    
      "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the library.
    
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
    and what the program that uses the Library does.
      
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.
    
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    
        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    
        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.
    
        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Library.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
    these notices.
    
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    
      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
    the Library into a program that is not a library.
    
      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.
    
      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    
      However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
    
      When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    
      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
    
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    
      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.
    
      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
    of these things:
    
        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)
    
        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    
        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.
    
        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.
    
        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
    
      For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
    the executable.
    
      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
    distribute.
    
      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    
        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.
    
        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.
    
      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
    this License.
    
      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    
      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
    
      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
    ordinary General Public License).
    
      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
        version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    
        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
        Lesser General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
      library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    That's all there is to it!
