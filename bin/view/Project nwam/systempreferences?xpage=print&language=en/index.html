<h1 id="HSystemPreferences"><span>System Preferences</span></h1><p><!--startimage:../system-preferences.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fsystem%2Dpreferences.png" alt="../system-preferences.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;This is where all network configuration is done. There is a surprising amount of functionality crammed into here.</p><p>&nbsp;The network related settings are located in a row of four icons:<br/><!--startimage:../internet-and-network.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Finternet%2Dand%2Dnetwork.png" alt="../internet-and-network.png"/><!--stopimage--><br/>&nbsp;The first of these has settings for Apple's proprietary ".mac" service. The third is settings related to their QuickTime multimedia framework (a surprising number of which seem network related).</p><h2 id="HNetworkPreferencesPane"><span>Network Preferences Pane</span></h2><p>&nbsp;The second, labeled Network, is where most "network-address" related settings are configured. The network settings are collected into groups called "Locations". From the online help:</p><blockquote>A network location is a group of settings for your network ports (your computer's Ethernet port, modem port, or AirPort Card, for example).</blockquote><p>If you often change network settings, you may find switching between locations quicker and easier than repeatedly modifying individual groups of settings.<br/>For example, you might want to make a location for "home," where you connect to the Internet with a telephone modem, and a location for "office," where you connect to your company network and the Internet using Ethernet or AirPort.</p><p>&nbsp;Each Location, in turn, has a set of Port Configurations, which have a definite order. Each Port Configuration, in turn, has settings for that particular "port" (link) including how to get an address, DNS settings, proxy settings, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;Note that Locations are shared by all users. This might be a bit of a surprise since, say, the ".Mac" settings are per-user.</p><p>&nbsp;The current location is only changed manually. Port configurations, on the other hand, are automatically changed based on their order and the presence/absence of network "signal". Changing a Location seems to reset all applications to use the new network settings (e.g. IM client logs off and then re logs in all accounts), but changing the Port Configuration does not.</p><h3 id="HNetworkStatus"><span>Network Status</span></h3><p>&nbsp;When this "Network" preference pane is first opened, it shows a summary of the current status of the ports for the current Location.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-status.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dstatus.png" alt="../network-status.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;In this case, this indicates that the default Location (called Automatic) has two potentially active ports: AirPort (wireless) and the internal modem. As you'll see in a moment, there are actually five ports defined as part of this Location, however three of them have no current potential for network connection, so are not shown here. If an ethernet cable were plugged in, it would then show up in this list.</p><p>&nbsp;Note that the "Configure..." button at the bottom will switch the display to showing the configuration settings for that particular Port Configuration. the "Disconnect..." button will start the "<!--startwikilink:internetconnect--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+nwam/internetconnect">Internet Connect</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->" application where one can disconnect etc.</p><h3 id="HCommonNetworkInterface"><span>Common Network Interface</span></h3><p>&nbsp;Some parts of this are common across all portions of the Network Preference Pane.</p><p>&nbsp;The "Assist me[sic]..." button displays a sheet asking what kind of assistance you want. "Diagnostics..." leads to the <!--startwikilink:networkdiagnostics--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+nwam/networkdiagnostics">Network Diagnostics</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> application, while "Assistant..." leads to the <!--startwikilink:nsa--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+nwam/nsa">Network Setup Assistant</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-assist-me.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dassist%2Dme.png" alt="../network-assist-me.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;The Location menu shows you the current locations as well as providing commands for changing these. In this screenshot, it shows two locations, the default "Automatic" and a newly created one called "Example Location"</p><p><!--startimage:../network-location-menu.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dlocation%2Dmenu.png" alt="../network-location-menu.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;Choosing to create a new Location simply displays a sheet which asks for a new name. The resulting Location has a Port Configuration for each port and no settings in any of the Port Configurations.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-new-location.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dnew%2Dlocation.png" alt="../network-new-location.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;Edit Location presents a sheet which lists the various locations. Double clicking on a location name is the same as clicking the Rename button and allows the Location's name to be changed. Duplicate and Delete do what you would expect.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-edit-location.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dedit%2Dlocation.png" alt="../network-edit-location.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;The "Show" menu has three sections. The first displays the network status for the currently active Location. Perhaps this is a bug, and perhaps it is a feature, but the "currently active" one is the one that last had its settings applied. Thus, if you switch the current location from the menu, and then display the "Network Status" information without first clicking "Apply Now", the status will show the status for the Location that currently is in effect on the system.</p><p>&nbsp;The next several items show each of the Port Configurations for the Location listed in the menu above in their preferred order. Choosing one of those allows you to edit/configure that particular Port Configuration. The last item gives a list of the Port Configurations for the Location listed in the menu above.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-show-menu.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dshow%2Dmenu.png" alt="../network-show-menu.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><h3 id="HNetworkPortConfiguration"><span>Network Port Configuration</span></h3><p>&nbsp;The Network Port Configuration section displays a list of all the Port Configurations for the Location listed at the top of the window.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration.png" alt="../network-port-configuration.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>The order of these ports is significant. In the next illustration, if there is network signal from both the Internal Modem and from the Built-in Ethernet, apps will use the Internal Modem Port Configuration if they try to make a network connection. These can be re-ordered using drag and drop:</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration-drag.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration%2Ddrag.png" alt="../network-port-configuration-drag.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;Port Configurations can also be made inactive, which means that the system will ignore those ports even if there is network signal there. This is done simply by unchecking the checkbox in the list (the Port Configuration remains in this list, but it disappears from the Show menu, above).</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration-inactive.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration%2Dinactive.png" alt="../network-port-configuration-inactive.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;It is possible to create a new Port Configuration. It isn't at all clear to me at the moment what some of this means or when it would be used. I assume this gets into much more advanced networking needs.</p><p>&nbsp;When you first click on the "New..." button, a sheet appears asking for the name of the port, and what port that name should be associated with. In this example, I've typed "New Port", though the default is the classic "Untitled".</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration-new-port1.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration%2Dnew%2Dport1.png" alt="../network-port-configuration-new-port1.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;If you expand the Port menu, you get not only a list of the ports we already know about, but two special ones, a "6 to 4" (I assume this is IPv6 to IPv4) and a Ling Aggregate.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration-new-port2.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration%2Dnew%2Dport2.png" alt="../network-port-configuration-new-port2.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;The last is most interesting, because when that is chosen, the sheet expands to display which ports may be aggregated. Why this lists only the two is not clear to me. Note that the underlying names (en0 and en1) have begun to poke their ugly noses into the end-user interface.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration-new-port3.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration%2Dnew%2Dport3.png" alt="../network-port-configuration-new-port3.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;Proceeding with the creation of a Link Aggregation port, this alert is then shown.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration-new-port4.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration%2Dnew%2Dport4.png" alt="../network-port-configuration-new-port4.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;I doubt it is very clear what is going on. As soon as one clicks OK, the ports in the list that you'd chosen to aggregate are disabled (but, not deleted), and the aggregated port is then listed. It is worth noting that the "Rename" button becomes "Edit..." when you have selected a Link Aggregate port, and that redisplays the sheet shown above so that you can change both the name and change which ports are in the aggregate.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration-new-port5.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration%2Dnew%2Dport5.png" alt="../network-port-configuration-new-port5.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;The "Rename" button (double clicking on a Port Configuration name does the same thing) allows you to edit the name of the Port Configuration.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration-rename.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration%2Drename.png" alt="../network-port-configuration-rename.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;Deleting a Port Configuration does one of two things. If this is a Port Configuration that was created by a user, then the whole port configuration is deleted and removed from the list. However, if it is one of the ones in the list when it was created, then the "Delete" button effectively deletes the Port configuration and creates a new (with original name), empty of settings, and inactive (unchecked) Port Configuration for the associated underlying link/port.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration-delete.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration%2Ddelete.png" alt="../network-port-configuration-delete.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;Duplicate makes a copy of the specified Port Configuration. I'm not sure what problem this solves.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-port-configuration-duplicate.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dport%2Dconfiguration%2Dduplicate.png" alt="../network-port-configuration-duplicate.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><h3 id="HInternalModemPortConfiguration"><span>Internal Modem Port Configuration</span></h3><p>&nbsp;This is the PPP tab of the Internal Modem Port Configuration. Note that the "Dial Now..." button starts up the <!--startwikilink:internetconnect--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+nwam/internetconnect">Internet Connect</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> application.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-internal-modem-ppp.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dinternal%2Dmodem%2Dppp.png" alt="../network-internal-modem-ppp.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;This is the sheet that is displayed when "PPP Options..." are chosen.</p><p><!--startimage:../network-internal-modem-ppp-options.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dinternal%2Dmodem%2Dppp%2Doptions.png" alt="../network-internal-modem-ppp-options.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;The choices available for IPv4 configuration:</p><p><!--startimage:../network-internal-modem-tcpip-menu.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dinternal%2Dmodem%2Dtcpip%2Dmenu.png" alt="../network-internal-modem-tcpip-menu.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;TCP/IP Settings (using PPP) (default):</p><p><!--startimage:../network-internal-modem-tcpip.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dinternal%2Dmodem%2Dtcpip.png" alt="../network-internal-modem-tcpip.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;TCP/IP Settings (Manually):</p><p><!--startimage:../network-internal-modem-tcpip-manually.png--><img src="/bin/download/Project+nwam/systempreferences/..%2Fnetwork%2Dinternal%2Dmodem%2Dtcpip%2Dmanually.png" alt="../network-internal-modem-tcpip-manually.png"/><!--stopimage--></p><p>&nbsp;TCP/IP Settings (AOL Dialup).
