6) TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, HOST IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU OR
ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,

WEBSITE, CONTENT OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.<p/>
8) Host reserves the right to investigate complaints or reported
violations of these Terms of Use, and/or applicable licenses and
copyright information on the Website and to take any action Host deems
appropriate including, without limitation, reporting and providing
information of any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement
officials, regulators, or other third parties, including disclosing any
information necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities
relating to user profiles, e-mail addresses, usage history, posted

9) Host reserves the right to seek all remedies available at law and
in equity for violations of these Terms of Use, including, but not
limited to, the right to block access from a particular Internet
address to this Website.<p/>
&#49;0) This Website may contain other proprietary notices, licenses and
copyright information, the terms of which must be observed and followed
by you. In the event of any conflict between the license(s) applicable
to Content or Services and the Terms of Use, the applicable license(s)
prevail. Except as otherwise expressly stated, by providing the Content
or Services, Host does not grant any licenses to any copyrights,

portions of the OpenSolaris source code are under Sun's Common
Development and Distribution License (refer to the download page for
specific details).<p/>
&#49;1) The Content provided on this Website is provided under the terms
and conditions of the applicable license(s) on the Website. Any Content
provided by you is made available to Users and Host under the terms of
the license(s) applicable to contributing such Content to the Website.
For all Content, including, without limitation, patent, copyright, and
other intellectual property rights in such Content, owned or licensable
by you at any time without payment, ideas, concepts, know-how and
techniques, uploaded, submitted or otherwise made available by you on
the Website or to the Users and/or Host (collectively "Material"), you
grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted)
Host a worldwide, unrestricted, royalty-free, fully paid up,
irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive license to use, make, reproduce,
import, compile, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, transmit, sell, distribute, sublicense, demonstrate,
market, disclose, have made, offer for sale, lease, transfer or
otherwise exploit such Materials, and/or derivative works thereof, and
authorize third parties to do any, some or all of the foregoing
including, but not limited to, sublicensing others to do any, some or
all of the foregoing indefinitely. You represent that you are legally
entitled to grant the rights and privileges conveyed by this section
and warrant that your Material, to the best of your knowledge, does not
violate any other party's patents, copyrights, trademarks or other
intellectual property rights.<p/>
&#49;2) You acknowledge that Host: (i) does not pre-screen Content; (ii)
has discretion to determine whether to post or not post Content; and
(iii) can delete, cease providing, or modify the Content at any time
for any reason. The Content on this Website may contain technical
inaccuracies or typographical errors. Host may also improve or change
the Content at any time without notice. Host reserves the right, at any
time, with or without cause and without notice, to modify, suspend or
terminate in whole or in part: (i) the Services, (ii) your use or
access to the Services, or (iii) both. Host is not liable to you or any
third party for any modification or deletion of Content, for any
posting refusal to post Content, or any modification, suspension or
termination of Services. Please understand that this is an active
Website and we expect that the Content is likely to change.<p/>
&#49;3) If you choose to register on this Website, you are responsible
for providing accurate and complete information about yourself during
registration and to updating such information to keep it current. You
accept all risks of unauthorized access to the information that you
provide. Host may, in its sole discretion, terminate the accounts or
access rights of Users who may have provided inaccurate or incomplete
information during registration. We hope that, given these
restrictions, you still take the time to provide a full profile which
lets other people in the community get to know you.<p/>
&#49;4) Host is committed to respecting the intellectual property rights
of others, and we ask our Users to do the same. Host may, in its sole
discretion, terminate the accounts or access rights of Users who may be
infringing or may otherwise be violating the intellectual property
rights of others. If you believe that your work has been copied on this
Website in a way that constitutes infringement, please contact the
copyright agent as described in the copyright policy set forth in
detail elsewhere on the Website. The Website, Services, and Content are
protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United
States and foreign countries. Except as expressly permitted in these
Terms of Use and any applicable license, you may not reproduce, modify,
or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, sell, transfer,
publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or otherwise use the
Website, Services, or Content. You may not copy or modify the HTML code
used to generate web pages on the Website.<p/>
&#49;5) California law and controlling U.S. Federal law govern any
action relating to these Terms of Use without regard to any
jurisdiction's choice law rules. You agree to submit all such disputes
to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California USA.<p/>
&#49;6) Host may amend these Terms of Use at any time by posting the
amended terms on this Website. By continuing to access or use the
Website, Services or Content after Host makes any such revision, you
agree to be bound by the revised Terms of Use.<p/>
&#49;7) "Host Trademarks" means all names, marks, brands, logos,
designs, trade dress, slogans and other designations Host uses in
connection with its products and services. You agree to comply with the
Trademark and Logo Usage Requirements located at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks">&#104;ttp://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks</a></span> and <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Main/Trademarks">Trademarks</a></span>.
You may not remove or alter any Host Trademarks, or co-brand your own
products or material with Host Trademarks, without Host's prior written
consent. You acknowledge Host's rights in Host Trademarks and agree
that any use of Host Trademarks by you shall inure to Host's sole
benefit. You agree not to incorporate any Host Trademarks into your
trademarks, service marks, company names, Internet addresses, domain
names, or any other similar designations, for use on or in connection
with computer or Internet-related products, services or technologies.<p/>
&#49;8) You consent to the collection, processing and storage by Host of
your personal information in accordance with the terms of Host's
Privacy Policy, which is available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://www.sun.com/privacy">&#104;ttp://www.sun.com/privacy</a></span>.
You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and the
terms of that privacy policy, with respect to any access, use and/or
submission by you of any personal information in connection with this
Website.<p/>
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if you choose to
participate in an open source or community source process on this
Website, whether by contributing code, participating in mailing lists
or sending e-mails, your participation is public and your privacy
cannot be protected to the extent that you provide personal information
such as your e-mail address. To the extent that you contribute code,
information, articles or other material to this Website containing
personal information, Host cannot protect the privacy of such personal
information and such material may be provided to others under the Terms
of Use and applicable licenses.<p/>
&#49;9) The Website may contain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements may include statements regarding market
expectations and opportunities, expectations about financials, research
and development and strategies, statements concerning Host's roadmaps,
market share growth, and product and service development and
introduction, and our continuous evaluation of the competitiveness of
our product and service offerings. These forward-looking statements are
just predictions and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results
may differ materially from results discussed in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include risks
related to adverse changes in general economic conditions, failure to
reduce costs, lack of success in technical advancements, the timely
development, production and acceptance of new products and services,
and Sun's ability to compete in a highly competitive and rapidly
changing marketplace. For a detailed listing of the potential factors
affecting Host's business and these forward-looking statements, please
refer to Host's periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K that are filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.<p/>
20) Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right
under the Terms of Use will not create a continuing waiver or any
expectation of non-enforcement. If any provision of the Terms of Use is
held invalid by any law or regulation of any government, or by any
court or arbitrator, such provision will be replaced with a new
provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, and the
other provisions of the Terms of Use will remain in full force and
effect.<p/>
21) In addition to the Terms of Use and unless otherwise noted, the
standard Host terms and conditions of sale in your jurisdiction govern
purchases you make through the Website, unless you have in effect a
separate valid written purchase or license agreement with Host for the
products or services purchased, in which case that separate agreement
governs, and in cases of conflict, prevails.<p/>
