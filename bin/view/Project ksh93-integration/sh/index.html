User Commands                                              KSH(1)

NAME
     ksh, rksh, pfksh - KornShell, a standard/restricted  command
     and programming language

SYNOPSIS
     ksh [ _abcefhikmnoprstuvxBCDP ] [ -R file ] [  _o  option  ]
     ... [ - ] [ arg ... ]
     rksh [ _abcefhikmnoprstuvxBCD ] [ -R file ] [  _o  option  ]
     ...  [ - ] [ arg ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     Ksh is a command and programming language that executes com-
     mands  read from a terminal or a file.  Rksh is a restricted
     version of the command interpreter ksh; it is used to set up
     login  names  and  execution environments whose capabilities
     are more  controlled  than  those  of  the  standard  shell.
     Rpfksh is a profile shell version of the command interpreter
     ksh; it is used to to execute commands with  the  attributes
     specified by the user's profiles (see pfexec(1)).  See Invo-
     cation below for the meaning of arguments to the shell.

  Definitions.
     A metacharacter is one of the following characters:

          ;   &amp;   (   )   |   &lt;   &gt;   new-line   space   tab

     A blank is a tab or a space.  An identifier is a sequence of
     letters,  digits,  or  underscores starting with a letter or
     underscore.  Identifiers are used as components of  variable
     names.   A  vname  is  a sequence of one or more identifiers
     separated by a . and optionally preceded by a ..  Vnames are
     used  as  function and variable names.  A word is a sequence
     of characters from the character set defined by the  current
     locale, excluding non-quoted metacharacters.

     A command is a sequence of characters in the syntax  of  the
     shell  language.   The  shell reads each command and carries
     out the  desired  action  either  directly  or  by  invoking
     separate utilities.  A built-in command is a command that is
     carried out by the shell itself without creating a  separate
     process.   Some commands are built-in purely for convenience
     and are not documented  here.   Built-ins  that  cause  side
     effects  in  the  shell  environment  and built-ins that are
     found before performing a path search (see Execution  below)
     are  documented here.  For historical reasons, some of these
     built-ins behave differently than other  built-ins  and  are
     called special built-ins.

  Commands.
     A simple-command is a  list  of  variable  assignments  (see
     Variable Assignments below) or a sequence of blank separated
     words  which  may  be  preceded  by  a  list   of   variable

RDS Standard Last change: User Environment Utilities            1

User Commands                                              KSH(1)

     assignments  (see Environment below).  The first word speci-
     fies the name of the command  to  be  executed.   Except  as
     specified below, the remaining words are passed as arguments
     to the invoked command.  The command name is passed as argu-
     ment  0 (see exec(2)).  The value of a simple-command is its
     exit status; 0-255 if it terminates normally; 256+signum  if
     it terminates abnormally (the name of the signal correspond-
     ing to the exit status can be obtained via the -l option  of
     the kill built-in utility).

     A pipeline is a sequence of one or more  commands  separated
     by  |.   The standard output of each command but the last is
     connected by a pipe(2) to the standard  input  of  the  next
     command.   Each command, except possibly the last, is run as
     a separate process; the shell waits for the last command  to
     terminate.  The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status
     of the last command unless the pipefail option  is  enabled.
     Each  pipeline  can be preceded by the reserved word ! which
     causes the exit status of the pipeline to become  0  if  the
     exit  status  of  the last command is non-zero, and 1 if the
     exit status of the last command is 0.

     A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines  separated  by
     ;,  &amp;,  |&amp;, &amp;&amp;, or ||, and optionally terminated by ;, &amp;, or
     |&amp;.  Of these five symbols, ;, &amp;, and  |&amp;  have  equal  pre-
     cedence, which is lower than that of &amp;&amp; and ||.  The symbols
     &amp;&amp; and || also  have  equal  precedence.   A  semicolon  (;)
     causes  sequential  execution  of the preceding pipeline; an
     ampersand (&amp;) causes asynchronous execution of the preceding
     pipeline (i.e., the shell does not wait for that pipeline to
     finish).  The symbol |&amp; causes asynchronous execution of the
     preceding  pipeline  with  a two-way pipe established to the
     parent shell; the standard input and output of  the  spawned
     pipeline can be written to and read from by the parent shell
     by applying the redirection operators &lt;&amp; and &gt;&amp; with  arg  p
     to  commands and by using -p option of the built-in commands
     read and print described later.  The symbol &amp;&amp;  (||)  causes
     the  list  following it to be executed only if the preceding
     pipeline returns a zero (non-zero) value.  One or more  new-
     lines  may  appear in a list instead of a semicolon, to del-
     imit a command.

     A command is either a simple-command or one of  the  follow-
     ing.   Unless otherwise stated, the value returned by a com-
     mand is that of the last simple-command executed in the com-
     mand.

     for vname [ in word ... ] ;do list ;done
          Each time a for command is executed, vname  is  set  to
          the  next word taken from the in word list.  If in word
          ...  is omitted, then the for command executes  the  do
          list  once  for  each  positional parameter that is set

          starting from 1 (see Parameter Expansion below).   Exe-
          cution ends when there are no more words in the list.

     for (( [expr1] ; [expr2] ; [expr3] )) ;do list ;done
          The arithmetic expression expr1 is evaluated first (see
          Arithmetic  evaluation  below).  The arithmetic expres-
          sion expr2 is repeatedly evaluated until  it  evaluates
          to  zero  and  when  non-zero, list is executed and the
          arithmetic expression expr3 evaluated.  If any  expres-
          sion  is omitted, then it behaves as if it evaluated to
          1.

     select vname [ in word ... ] ;do list ;done
          A  select  command  prints  on  standard  error   (file
          descriptor  2)  the  set  of  words, each preceded by a
          number.  If in word ...  is  omitted,  then  the  posi-
          tional parameters starting from 1 are used instead (see
          Parameter Expansion below).  The PS3 prompt is  printed
          and  a  line  is read from the standard input.  If this
          line consists of the number of one of the listed words,
          then the value of the variable vname is set to the word
          corresponding to this number.  If this line  is  empty,
          the  selection  list  is  printed again.  Otherwise the
          value of the variable vname is set to null.   The  con-
          tents  of the line read from standard input is saved in
          the variable REPLY.  The  list  is  executed  for  each
          selection  until a break or end-of-file is encountered.
          If the REPLY variable is set to null by  the  execution
          of  list,  then  the  selection  list is printed before
          displaying the PS3 prompt for the next selection.

     case word in [ [(]pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list ;; ] ... esac
          A  case  command  executes the list associated with the
          first pattern that matches word.  The form of the  pat-
          terns is the same as that used for file-name generation
          (see File Name  Generation  below).   The  ;;  operator
          causes  execution  of case to terminate.  If ;&amp; is used
          in place of ;; the next subsequent list,  if  any,   is
          executed.

;fi
     if list ;then list [ elif list ;then list ] ... [  ;else  list  ]
          The  list following if is executed and, if it returns a
          zero exit status, the list following the first then  is
          executed.   Otherwise,  the list following elif is exe-
          cuted and, if its value is zero, the list following the
          next  then  is  executed.  Failing each successive elif
          list, the else list is executed.  If the  if  list  has
          non-zero  exit  status  and there is no else list, then
          the if command returns a zero exit status.

     while list ;do list ;done

RDS Standard Last change: User Environment Utilities            3

User Commands                                              KSH(1)

     until list ;do list ;done
          A while command repeatedly executes the while list and,
          if  the  exit status of the last command in the list is
          zero, executes the do list;  otherwise  the  loop  ter-
          minates.   If  no commands in the do list are executed,
          then the while command  returns  a  zero  exit  status;
          until  may be used in place of while to negate the loop
          termination test.

     ((expression))
          The expression is evaluated using the rules for  arith-
          metic  evaluation described below.  If the value of the
          arithmetic expression is non-zero, the exit  status  is
          0, otherwise the exit status is 1.

     (list)
          Execute list in a separate environment.  Note, that  if
          two adjacent open parentheses are needed for nesting, a
          space must be inserted to avoid evaluation as an arith-
          metic command as described above.

     { list;}
          list is simply executed.  Note that  unlike  the  meta-
          characters ( and ), { and } are reserved words and must
          occur at the beginning of a line or after a ; in  order
          to be recognized.

     [[ expression ]]
          Evaluates expression and returns  a  zero  exit  status
          when  expression  is true.  See Conditional Expressions
          below, for a description of expression.

     function varname { list ;}
     varname () { list ;}
          Define a function which is referenced  by  varname.   A
          function whose varname contains a . is called a discip-
          line function and the portion of the varname  preceding
          the last . must refer to an existing variable. The body
          of the function is the list of commands between  {  and
          }.  A function defined with the function varname syntax
          can also be used as  an  argument  to  the  .   special
          built-in  command  to get the equivalent behavior as if
          the varname() syntax were  used  to  define  it.   (See
          Functions below.)

     time [ pipeline ]
          If pipeline is omitted the user and system time for the
          current  shell and completed child processes is printed
          on standard error.  Otherwise, pipeline is executed and
          the  elapsed  time  as well as the user and system time
          are printed on standard error.  The TIMEFORMAT variable
          may  be  set  to a format string that specifies how the

RDS Standard Last change: User Environment Utilities            4

User Commands                                              KSH(1)

          timing information  should  be  displayed.   See  Shell
          Variables  below  for  a  description of the TIMEFORMAT
          variable.

     The following reserved words are recognized as reserved only
     when  they  are  the  first  word  of  a command and are not
     quoted:

     if then else elif fi case esac for while until do done  {  }
     function select time [[ ]] !

  Variable Assignments.
     One or more variable assignments can start a simple  command
     or can be arguments to the typeset, export, or readonly spe-
     cial built-in commands.  The syntax for an assignment is  of
     the form:

     varname=word
     varname[word]=word
          No space is permitted between  varname  and  the  =  or
          between = and word.

     varname=(assign_list)
          No space is permitted between varname and  the  =.   An
          assign_list can be one of the following:
                    word ...
                         Indexed array assignment.
                    [word]=word ...
                         Associative array assignment.
                    assignment ...
                         Compound  variable   assignment.    This
                         creates a compound variable varname with
                         sub-variables of the form  varname.name,
                         where   name  is  the  name  portion  of
                         assignment.  The value of  varname  will
                         contain  all  the  assignment  elements.
                         Additional  assignments  made  to   sub-
                         variables   of   varname  will  also  be
                         displayed as part of the value  of  var-
                         name.   If no assignments are specified,
                         varname  will  be  a  compound  variable
                         allowing  subsequence  child elements to
                         be defined.

     A word beginning with # causes that word and all the follow-
     ing characters up to a new-line to be ignored.
  Aliasing.
     The first word of each command is replaced by the text of an
     alias  if an alias for this word has been defined.  An alias
     name consists of any number of  characters  excluding  meta-
     characters,  quoting  characters, file expansion characters,
     parameter expansion and command substitution characters, and
     =.   The  replacement  string  can  contain  any valid shell
     script including the metacharacters listed above.  The first
     word  of  each  command in the replaced text, other than any
     that are in the process of being replaced,  will  be  tested
     for  aliases.  If the last character of the alias value is a
     blank then the word following the alias will also be checked
     for  alias  substitution.   Aliases  can be used to redefine
     built-in  commands  but  cannot  be  used  to  redefine  the
     reserved  words  listed  above.   Aliases can be created and
     listed with the alias command and can be  removed  with  the
     unalias command.
     Aliasing is performed when scripts are read, not while  they
     are  executed.   Therefore, for an alias to take effect, the
     alias definition command has to be executed before the  com-
     mand which references the alias is read.
     The following aliases are compiled into the shell but can be
     unset or redefined:
                         autoload='typeset -fu'
                         command='command  '
                         fc=hist
                         float='typeset -E'
                         functions='typeset -f'
                         hash='alias -t ~--'
                         history='hist -l'
                         integer='typeset -i'
                         nameref='typeset -n'
                         nohup='nohup  '
                         r='hist -s'

                         source='command .'
                         stop='kill -s STOP'
                         suspend='kill -s STOP $$'

                         type='whence -v'

  Tilde Substitution.
     After alias substitution is performed, each word is  checked

User Commands                                              KSH(1)

     to see if it begins with an unquoted ~.  For tilde substitu-
     tion, word also refers to  the  word  portion  of  parameter
     expansion (see Parameter Expansion below).  If it does, then
     the word up to a / is checked to see if it  matches  a  user
     name  in the password database (often the /etc/passwd file).
     If a match is found, the ~ and the matched  login  name  are
     replaced  by the login directory of the matched user.  If no
     match is found, the original text is left unchanged.  A ~ by
     itself,  or in front of a /, is replaced by $HOME.  A ~ fol-
     lowed by a + or - is replaced  by  the  value  of  $PWD  and
     $OLDPWD respectively.

     In addition, when expanding  a  variable  assignment,  tilde
     substitution  is  attempted when the value of the assignment
     begins with a ~, and when a ~ appears after a :.  The : also
     terminates a ~ login name.

  Command Substitution.
     The standard output from a command enclosed  in  parentheses
     preceded by a dollar sign ( $() ) or a pair of grave accents
     (``) may be used as part or all of  a  word;  trailing  new-
     lines  are  removed.   In  the  second  (obsolete) form, the
     string between the quotes is processed for  special  quoting
     characters  before  the  command  is  executed  (see Quoting
     below).   The  command  substitution  $(cat  file)  can   be
     replaced by the equivalent but faster $(&lt;file).  The command
     substitution $(n&lt;#) will expand to the current  byte  offset
     for file descriptor n.

  Arithmetic Substitution.
     An arithmetic expression enclosed in double parentheses pre-
     ceded by a dollar sign ( $(()) ) is replaced by the value of
     the arithmetic expression within the double parentheses.

  Process Substitution.
     This feature is only  available  on  versions  of  the  UNIX
     operating system that support the /dev/fd directory for nam-
     ing open files.  Each command argument of the  form  &lt;(list)
     or &gt;(list) will run process list asynchronously connected to
     some file in /dev/fd.  The name of this file will become the
     argument  to  the  command.   If the form with &gt; is selected
     then writing on this file will provide input for list.  If &lt;
     is  used,  then  the file passed as an argument will contain
     the output of the list process.  For example,

          paste &lt;(cut -f1 file1) &lt;(cut -f3 file2)  |  tee  &gt;(pro-
          cess1) &gt;(process2)

     cuts fields 1 and 3 from the files file1 and  file2  respec-
     tively,  pastes  the  results  together, and sends it to the
     processes process1 and process2, as well as putting it  onto
     the standard output.  Note that the file, which is passed as

User Commands                                              KSH(1)

     an argument to the command, is a UNIX  pipe(2)  so  programs
     that expect to lseek(2) on the file will not work.

  Parameter Expansion.
     A parameter is a variable, one or more digits, or any of the
     characters  *,  @, #, ?, -, $, and !.  A variable is denoted
     by a vname.  To create a variable whose vname contains a  .,
     a  variable  whose  vname  consists of everything before the
     last . must already exist.  A variable has a value and  zero
     or  more  attributes.   Variables can be assigned values and
     attributes by using the typeset  special  built-in  command.
     The  attributes  supported  by the shell are described later
     with the typeset special built-in command.   Exported  vari-
     ables pass values and attributes to the environment.

     The shell supports both indexed and associative arrays.   An
     element  of  an array variable is referenced by a subscript.
     A subscript for an indexed array is denoted by an arithmetic
     expression (see Arithmetic evaluation below) between a [ and
     a ].  To assign values to an indexed array, use set -A vname
     value  ...  .   The  value  of all subscripts must be in the
     range of  0  through  4095.   Indexed  arrays  need  not  be
     declared.   Any  reference  to  a variable with a valid sub-
     script is legal and an array will be created if necessary.

     An associative array  is  created  with  the  -A  option  to
     typeset.  A subscript for an associative array is denoted by
     a string enclosed between [ and ].

     Referencing any array without a subscript is  equivalent  to
     referencing the array with subscript 0.

     The value of a variable may be assigned by writing:

          vname=value [ vname=value ] ...

     or
          vname[subscript]=value [ vname[subscript]=value ] ...
     Note that no space is allowed before or after the =.
     A nameref is a variable that is a reference to another vari-
     able.   A  nameref  is  created  with  the  -n  attribute of
     typeset.  The value of the  variable  at  the  time  of  the
     typeset command becomes the variable that will be referenced
     whenever the nameref variable is used.  The name of  a  nam-
     eref  cannot  contain a ..  When a variable or function name
     contains a ., and the portion of the name up to the first  .
     matches  the  name of a nameref, the variable referred to is
     obtained by replacing the nameref portion with the  name  of
     the  variable  referenced  by  the nameref.  If a nameref is
     used as the index of a for loop, a name reference  is  esta-
     blished  for  each  item  in the list.  A nameref provides a
     convenient way to refer to the variable  inside  a  function

User Commands                                              KSH(1)

     whose  name  is  passed  as  an argument to a function.  For
     example, if the name of a variable is passed  as  the  first
     argument to a function, the command
          typeset -n var=$1
     inside the function causes references and assignments to var
     to  be references and assignments to the variable whose name
     has been passed to the function.
     If either of the floating point attributes, -E,  or  -F,  or
     the  integer attribute, -i, is set for vname, then the value
     is subject to arithmetic evaluation as described below.
     Positional parameters, parameters denoted by a  number,  may
     be  assigned  values  with the set special built-in command.
     Parameter $0 is set from argument zero  when  the  shell  is
     invoked.
     The character $ is used to introduce  substitutable  parame-
     ters.
     ${parameter}
          The shell reads all  the  characters  from  ${  to  the
          matching } as part of the same word even if it contains
          braces or metacharacters.  The value, if  any,  of  the
          parameter is substituted.  The braces are required when
          parameter is followed by a letter, digit, or underscore
          that is not to be interpreted as part of its name, when
          the variable name contains a ., or when a  variable  is
          subscripted.   If  parameter is one or more digits then
          it is a positional parameter.  A  positional  parameter
          of  more than one digit must be enclosed in braces.  If
          parameter is * or @, then all  the  positional  parame-
          ters, starting with $1, are substituted (separated by a
          field separator character).  If  an  array  vname  with
          subscript  *  or  @ is used, then the value for each of
          the elements is substituted,  separated  by  the  first
          character of the value of IFS.
     ${#parameter}
          If parameter is * or @, the number of positional param-
          eters  is  substituted.   Otherwise,  the length of the
          value of the parameter is substituted.
     ${#vname[*]}
     ${#vname[@]}
          The number of elements in the array  vname  is  substi-
          tuted.

     ${!vname}
          Expands to the name of  the  variable  referred  to  by
          vname.   This will be vname except when vname is a name
          reference.

     ${!vname[subscript]}
          Expands to name of the subscript unless subscript is  *
          or  @.   When  subscript  is  *, the list of array sub-
          scripts for vname is generated.  For a variable that is
          not  an  array,  the value is 0 if the variable is set.

          Otherwise it is null.  When subscript  is  @,  same  as
          above,  except  that  when  used in double quotes, each
          array subscript yields a separate argument.

     ${!prefix*}
          Expands to the names of the variables whose names begin
          with prefix.

     ${parameter:-word}
          If parameter is set and is non-null then substitute its
          value; otherwise substitute word.

     ${parameter:=word}
          If parameter is not set or is null then set it to word;
          the  value of the parameter is then substituted.  Posi-
          tional parameters may not be assigned to in this way.

     ${parameter:?word}
          If parameter is set and is non-null then substitute its
          value;  otherwise,  print  word and exit from the shell
          (if not interactive).  If word is omitted then a  stan-
          dard message is printed.

     ${parameter:+word}
          If parameter is set and  is  non-null  then  substitute
          word; otherwise substitute nothing.

     In the above, word is not evaluated unless it is to be  used
     as  the  substituted string, so that, in the following exam-
     ple, pwd is executed only if d is not set or is null:

          print ${d:-$(pwd)}

     If the colon ( : ) is omitted from  the  above  expressions,
     then the shell only checks whether parameter is set or not.

     ${parameter:offset:length}
     ${parameter:offset}
          Expands to the portion of the value of parameter start-
          ing  at  the  character (counting from 0) determined by
          expanding offset as an arithmetic expression  and  con-
          sisting  of  the number of characters determined by the
          arithmetic expression defined by length.  In the second
          form, the remainder of the value is used. If A negative
          offset counts backwards  from  the  end  of  parameter.
          Note  that one or more blanks is required in front of a
          minus sign to prevent the shell from  interpreting  the
          operator as :-.  If parameter is * or @, or is an array
          name indexed by * or @, then offset and length refer to
          the array index and number of elements respectively.  A
          negative offset is taken relative to one  greater  than
          the  highest  subscript  for indexed arrays.  The order

          for associate arrays is unspecified.
     ${parameter#pattern}
     ${parameter##pattern}
          If the shell pattern matches the beginning of the value
          of  parameter,  then the value of this expansion is the
          value  of  the  parameter  with  the  matched   portion
          deleted;  otherwise the value of this parameter is sub-
          stituted.  In the first form the smallest matching pat-
          tern  is  deleted  and  in  the second form the largest
          matching pattern is deleted.  When parameter is  @,  *,
          or  an  array  variable with subscript @ or *, the sub-
          string operation is applied to each element in turn.

     ${parameter%pattern}
     ${parameter%%pattern}
          If the shell pattern matches the end of  the  value  of
          parameter,  then  the  value  of  this expansion is the
          value of the parameter with the matched  part  deleted;
          otherwise  substitute  the  value of parameter.  In the
          first form the smallest matching pattern is deleted and
          in  the  second  form  the  largest matching pattern is
          deleted.  When parameter is @, *, or an array  variable
          with  subscript  @  or  *,  the  substring operation is
          applied to each element in turn.

     ${parameter/pattern/string}
     ${parameter//pattern/string}
     ${parameter/#pattern/string}
     ${parameter/%pattern/string}
          Expands parameter and replaces  the  longest  match  of
          pattern  with  the given string.  Each occurrence of \n
          in string is replaced by the portion of parameter  that
          matches  the n-th sub-pattern.  In the first form, only
          the first occurrence of pattern is  replaced.   In  the
          second  form, each match for pattern is replaced by the
          given string.  The third  form  restricts  the  pattern
          match  to  the beginning of the string while the fourth
          form restricts the pattern match  to  the  end  of  the
          string.   When  string  is  null,  the  pattern will be
          deleted and the / in front of string  may  be  omitted.
          When  parameter is @, *, or an array variable with sub-
          script @ or *, the substitution operation is applied to
          each element in turn.  In this case, the string portion
          of word will be re-evaluated for each element.

     The following parameters are automatically set by the shell:

               The current depth for subshells and  command  sub-
               stitution.
          .sh.value
               Set to the value of the variable at the time  that
               the set or append discipline function is invoked.
          .sh.version
               Set to a value that identifies the version of this
               shell.
          LINENO
               The current line number within the script or func-
               tion being executed.
          OLDPWD
               The previous working directory set by the cd  com-
               mand.
          OPTARG
               The value of the last option argument processed by
               the getopts built-in command.
          OPTIND
               The index of the last option argument processed by
               the getopts built-in command.
          PPID The process number of the parent of the shell.
          PWD  The present working directory set by the  cd  com-
               mand.
          RANDOM
               Each time this variable is  referenced,  a  random
               integer,   uniformly  distributed  between  0  and
               32767,  is  generated.   The  sequence  of  random
               numbers  can be initialized by assigning a numeric
               value to RANDOM.
          REPLY
               This variable is set by the select  statement  and
               by the read built-in command when no arguments are
               supplied.
          SECONDS
               Each time this variable is referenced, the  number
               of seconds since shell invocation is returned.  If
               this variable is assigned a value, then the  value
               returned upon reference will be the value that was
               assigned plus the  number  of  seconds  since  the
               assignment.

     The following variables are used by the shell:
          CDPATH
               The search path for the cd command.
          COLUMNS
               If this variable is set,  the  value  is  used  to
               define  the width of the edit window for the shell
               edit modes and for printing select lists.

          EDITOR
               If the value  of  this  variable  ends  in  emacs,
               gmacs,  or  vi and the VISUAL variable is not set,
               then the corresponding option (see Special Command
               set below) will be turned on.
          ENV  If this variable is set, then parameter expansion,
               command  substitution, and arithmetic substitution
               are performed on the value to generate  the  path-
               name  of the script that will be executed when the
               shell is invoked  (see  Invocation  below).   This
               file  is  typically  used  for  alias and function
               definitions.  The default value is $HOME/.kshrc.
          FCEDIT
               Obsolete name for the default editor name for  the
               hist command.  FCEDIT is not used when HISTEDIT is
               set.
          FIGNORE
               A pattern that defines the set of  filenames  that
               will be ignored when performing filename matching.
          FPATH
               The search path  for  function  definitions.   The
               directories  in  this path are searched for a file
               with the same name as the function or command when
               a function with the -u attribute is referenced and
               when a command is not  found.   If  an  executable
               file  with the name of that command is found, then
               it is read and executed in  the  current  environ-
               ment.   Unlike PATH, the current directory must be
               represented explictily by . rather than  by  adja-
               cent : characters or a beginning or ending :.
          HISTCMD
               Number of the current command in the history file.
          HISTEDIT
               Name for the default editor name for the hist com-
               mand.
          HISTFILE
               If this variable is set when the shell is invoked,
               then  the  value  is the pathname of the file that
               will be used to store  the  command  history  (see
               Command Re-entry below).
          HISTSIZE
               If this variable is set when the shell is invoked,
               then  the  number  of  previously entered commands
               that are accessible by this shell will be  greater
               than or equal to this number.  The default is 128.
          HOME The default argument (home directory) for  the  cd
               command.
          IFS  Internal field separators,  normally  space,  tab,
               and new-line that are used to separate the results
               of command substitution or parameter expansion and
               to separate fields with the built-in command read.

               separate  arguments for the "$*" substitution (see
               Quoting below).  Each single occurrence of an  IFS
               character  in  the string to be split, that is not
               in the isspace character class, and  any  adjacent
               characters  in IFS that are in the isspace charac-
               ter class, delimit a field.  One or  more  charac-
               ters  in  IFS that belong to the isspace character
               class, delimit a field.  In addition, if the  same
               isspace  character  appears  consecutively  inside
               IFS, this character is treated as if it  were  not
               in  the  isspace class, so that if IFS consists of
               two tab characters, then two adjacent tab  charac-
               ters delimit a null field.
          LANG This variable determines the locale  category  for
               any  category  not  specifically  selected  with a
               variable starting with LC_ or LANG.
          LC_ALL
               This variable overrides  the  value  of  the  LANG
               variable and any other LC_ variable.
          LC_COLLATE
               This variable determines the locale  category  for
               character collation information.
          LC_CTYPE
               This variable determines the locale  category  for
               character  handling  functions.  It determines the
               character classes for pattern matching  (see  File
               Name Generation below).
          LC_NUMERIC
               This variable determines the locale  category  for
               the decimal point character.
          LINES
               If this variable is set,  the  value  is  used  to
               determine  the  column  length for printing select
               lists.  Select lists will print  vertically  until
               about two-thirds of LINES lines are filled.
          MAIL If this variable is set to the name of a mail file
               and  the  MAILPATH  variable  is not set, then the
               shell informs the user of arrival of mail  in  the
               specified file.
          MAILCHECK
               This variable specifies how often (in seconds) the
               shell  will  check for changes in the modification
               time of any of the files specified by the MAILPATH
               or  MAIL  variables.   The  default  value  is 600
               seconds.  When the time has elapsed the shell will
               check before issuing the next prompt.
          MAILPATH
               A colon ( : ) separated list of  file  names.   If
               this  variable  is set, then the shell informs the
               user of any modifications to the  specified  files
               that  have  occurred  within  the  last  MAILCHECK
               seconds.  Each file name can be followed  by  a  ?

               and  a  message that will be printed.  The message
               will undergo parameter expansion, command  substi-
               tution, and arithmetic substitution with the vari-
               able $_ defined as the name of the file  that  has
               changed.   The default message is you have mail in
               $_.
          PATH The  search  path  for  commands  (see   Execution
               below).  The user may not change PATH if executing
               under rksh (except in .profile).
          PS1  The value of this variable is expanded for parame-
               ter  expansion,  command  substitution, and arith-
               metic substitution to define  the  primary  prompt
               string which by default is ``$''.  The character !
               in the primary prompt string is  replaced  by  the
               command  number (see Command Re-entry below).  Two
               successive occurrences of ! will produce a  single
               ! when the prompt string is printed.
          PS2  Secondary prompt string, by default ``&gt; ''.
          PS3  Selection prompt string used within a select loop,
               by default ``#? ''.
          PS4  The value of this variable is expanded for parame-
               ter  evaluation,  command substitution, and arith-
               metic substitution and precedes each  line  of  an
               execution  trace.   By default, PS4 is ``+ ''.  In
               addition when PS4 is unset,  the  execution  trace
               prompt is also ``+ ''.
          SHELL
               The pathname of the shell is kept in the  environ-
               ment.   At  invocation,  if  the  basename of this
               variable is rsh, rksh, or  krsh,  then  the  shell
               becomes  restricted.  If it is pfsh or pfksh, then
               the shell becomes a profile shell (see pfexec(1)).
          TIMEFORMAT
               The value of this parameter is used  as  a  format
               string  specifying  how the timing information for
               pipelines prefixed with  the  time  reserved  word
               should be displayed.  The % character introduces a
               format sequence that is expanded to a  time  value
               or  other  information.   The format sequences and
               their meanings are as follows.
               %%        A literal %.
               %[p][l]R  The elapsed time in seconds.
               %[p][l]U  The number of CPU seconds spent in  user
                         mode.
               %[p][l]S  The number of CPU seconds spent in  sys-
                         tem mode.
               %P        The CPU percentage, computed as (U +  S)
                         / R.

               The braces denote optional portions.  The optional
               p  is a digit specifying the precision, the number
               of fractional digits after  a  decimal  point.   A

               value  of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to
               be output.  At most three places after the decimal
               point can be displayed; values of p greater than 3
               are treated as 3.  If  p  is  not  specified,  the
               value 3 is used.

               The optional l specifies a longer format,  includ-
               ing  hours  if  greater  than  zero,  minutes, and
               seconds of the form HHhMMmSS.FFs.  The value of  p
               determines   whether   or   not  the  fraction  is
               included.

               All other characters are output without change and
               a  trailing  newline  is  added.   If  unset,  the
               default                                     value,
               $'\nreal\t%2lR\nuser\t%2lU\nsys%2lS', is used.  If
               the  value  is  null,  no  timing  information  is
               displayed.

          TMOUT
               If set to a value greater than zero, TMOUT will be
               the  default  timeout  value for the read built-in
               command.  The select compound  command  terminates
               after TMOUT seconds when input is from a terminal.
               Otherwise, the shell will terminate if a  line  is
               not   entered  within  the  prescribed  number  of
               seconds while reading from a terminal.  (Note that
               the shell can be compiled with a maximum bound for
               this value which cannot be exceeded.)

          VISUAL
               If the value  of  this  variable  ends  in  emacs,
               gmacs,  or  vi  then the corresponding option (see
               Special Command set below) will be turned on.  The
               value of VISUAL overrides the value of EDITOR.

     The shell gives default values to PATH, PS1, PS2, PS3,  PS4,
     MAILCHECK,  FCEDIT,  TMOUT  and IFS, while HOME, SHELL, ENV,
     and MAIL are not set at all by the shell (although  HOME  is
     set  by  login(1)).  On some systems MAIL and SHELL are also
     set by login(1).

  Field Splitting.
     After parameter  expansion  and  command  substitution,  the
     results of substitutions are scanned for the field separator
     characters (those found in  IFS)  and  split  into  distinct
     fields  where  such  characters  are  found.   Explicit null
     fields ("" or '') are retained.  Implicit null fields (those
     resulting  from  parameters  that  have no values or command
     substitutions with no output) are removed.

     If the braceexpand (-B) option  is  set  then  each  of  the
     fields resulting from IFS are checked to see if they contain
     one or more of the brace patterns {*,*}, {l1..l2} , {n1..n2}
     ,  {n1..n2%  fmt}  ,  {n1..n2 ..n3} , or {n1..n2 ..n3%fmt} ,
     where * represents any  character,  l1,l2  are  letters  and
     n1,n2,n3 are signed numbers and fmt is a format specified as
     used by  printf.   In  each  case,  fields  are  created  by
     prepending  the  characters  before  the { and appending the
     characters after the } to each of the strings  generated  by
     the  characters  between  the { and }.  The resulting fields
     are checked to see if they have any brace patterns.

     In the first form,  a  field  is  created  for  each  string
     between  { and ,, between , and ,, and between , and }.  The
     string represented by * can contain embedded matching {  and
     }  without  quoting.  Otherwise, each { and } with * must be
     quoted.

     In the seconds form, l1 and l2 must  both  be  either  upper
     case  or  both be lower case characters in the C locale.  In
     this case a field is created for each character from l1 thru
     l2.

     In the remaining forms, a field is created for  each  number
     starting at n1 and continuing until it reaches n2 increment-
     ing n1 by n3.  The the  cases  where  n3  is  not  specified
     behave  as  if  n3  where  1 if n1&lt;=n2 and -1 otherwise.  If
     forms which specify %fmt any format flags, widths and preci-
     sions can be specified and fmt can end in any of the specif-
     iers  cdiouxX.    For   example,   {a,z}{1..5..3%02d}{b..c}x
     expands  to the 8 fields, a01bx, a01cx, a04bx, a04cx, z01bx,
     z01cx, z04bx and z4cx.

  File Name Generation.
     Following splitting, each field is scanned for  the  charac-
     ters  *,  ?, (, and [ unless the -f option has been set.  If
     one of these characters appears, then the word  is  regarded
     as  a  pattern.   Each file name component that contains any
     pattern  character  is  replaced  with  a  lexicographically
     sorted  set  of  names  that  matches  the pattern from that
     directory.  If no file name is found that matches  the  pat-
     tern, then that component of the filename is left unchanged.
     If FIGNORE is  set,  then  each  file  name  component  that
     matches  the  pattern  defined  by  the  value of FIGNORE is
     ignored when generating the matching filenames.  The names .
     and .. are also ignored.  If FIGNORE is not set, the charac-
     ter . at the start of  each  file  name  component  will  be
     ignored   unless   the   first   character  of  the  pattern
     corresponding to this component is the character .   itself.
     Note,  that  for  other uses of pattern matching the / and .
     are not treated specially.

          *    Matches any string,  including  the  null  string.
               When  used for filename expansion, if the globstar
               option is on, two  adjacent  *'s  by  itself  will
               match  all  files and zero or more directories and
               subdirectories.  If followed  by  a  /  than  only
               directories and subdirectories will match.
          ?    Matches any single character.
          [...]
               Matches any one of  the  enclosed  characters.   A
               pair  of  characters  separated  by  - matches any
               character lexically between the  pair,  inclusive.
               If  the first character following the opening [ is
               a ! then any character not enclosed is matched.  A
               -  can be included in the character set by putting
               it as the first or last character.
               Within [ and ], character classes can be specified
               with  the  syntax [:class:]  where class is one of
               the following classes defined in the ANSI-C  stan-

          Within [ and ], an equivalence class can  be  specified
          with the syntax [=c=] which matches all characters with
          the same primary collation weight (as  defined  by  the
          current locale) as the character c.

          bol symbol.
     A pattern-list is a list of one or more  patterns  separated
     from  each other with a &amp; or |.  A &amp; signifies that all pat-
     terns must be matched whereas | requires that only one  pat-
     tern  be matched.  Composite patterns can be formed with one
     or more of the following sub-patterns:
          ?(pattern-list)
               Optionally matches any one of the given patterns.
          *(pattern-list)
               Matches zero or more occurrences of the given pat-
               terns.
          +(pattern-list)
               Matches one or more occurrences of the given  pat-
               terns.
          {n}(pattern-list)
               Matches n occurrences of the given patterns.
          {m,n}(pattern-list)
               Matches from m to n occurrences of the given  pat-
               terns.   If m is omitted, 0 will be used.  If n is
               omitted at least m occurrences will be matched.
          @(pattern-list)
               Matches exactly one of the given patterns.
          !(pattern-list)
               Matches anything except one of the given patterns.
     By default, each pattern,  or  sub-pattern  will  match  the

     longest string possible consistent with generating the long-
     est overall match.  If more than one match is possible,  the
     one  starting closest to the beginning of the string will be
     chosen.   However, for each of the above compound patterns a
     -  can  be  inserted in front of the ( to cause the shortest
     match to the specified pattern-list to be used.

     When  pattern-list  is  contained  within  parenthesis,  the
     backslash  character \ is treated specially even when inside
     a character class.   All ANSI-C character escapes are recog-
     nized  and  match  the specified character.  In addition the
     following escape sequences are recognized:
          \d   Matches any charcter in the digit class.
          \D   Matches any charcter not in the digit class.
          \s   Matches any charcter in the space class.
          \S   Matches any charcter not in the space class.
          \w   Matches any charcter in the word class.
          \W   Matches any charcter not in the word class.

     A pattern of the form %(pattern-pair(s))  is  a  sub-pattern
     that  can  be  used  to  match nested character expressions.
     Each pattern-pair is a two character sequence  which  cannot
     contain &amp; or |.  The first pattern-pair specifies the start-
     ing and ending characters for the  match.   Each  subsequent
     pattern-pair  represents the beginning and ending characters
     of a nested group that will be skipped  over  when  counting
     starting  and  ending  character  matches.   The behavior is
     unspecified when the first character of  a  pattern-pair  is
     alpha-numeric except for the following:
          D    Causes  the  ending  character  to  terminate  the
               search for this pattern without finding a match.
          E    Causes the ending character to be  interpreted  as
               an escape character.
          L    Causes the ending character to be interpreted as a
               quote  character  causing  all  characters  to  be
               ignored when looking for a match.
          Q    Causes the ending character to be interpreted as a
               quote  character causing all characters other than
               any escape character to be  ignored  when  looking
               for a match.
     Thus, %({}Q"E\), matches characters starting at { until  the
     matching } is found not counting any { or } that is inside a
     double quoted string or preceded by the escape character  \.
     Without the {} this pattern matches any C language string.

     Each sub-pattern in a composite pattern is numbered,  start-
     ing  at 1, by the location of the ( within the pattern.  The
     sequence \n, where n is a single digit and  \n  comes  after
     the  n-th.  sub-pattern, matches the same string as the sub-
     pattern itself.

     Finally a pattern  can  contain  sub-patterns  of  the  form
     ~(options:pattern-list).   where either options or :pattern-
     list can be omitted.  Unlike, the other  compound  patterns,
     these  sub-patterns  are  not  counted  in the numbered sub-
     patterns.  If options is present, it can consist of  one  or
     more of the following:
          +    Enable  the  following  options.   This   is   the
               default.
          -    Disable the following options.
          i    Treat the match as case insensitive.
          g    File the longest  match  (greedy).   This  is  the
               default.
     If both options and :pattern-list are  specified,  then  the
     options  apply  only  to   pattern-list.   Otherwise,  these
     options remain in effect until they are disabled by a subse-
     quent  ~(...)  or  at  the end of the sub-pattern containing
     ~(...).

  Quoting.
     Each of the metacharacters listed earlier  (see  Definitions
     above)  has a special meaning to the shell and causes termi-
     nation of a word unless quoted.  A character may  be  quoted
     (i.e.,  made  to stand for itself) by preceding it with a \.
     The pair \new-line  is  removed.   All  characters  enclosed
     between  a  pair of single quote marks ('') that is not pre-
     ceded by a $ are  quoted.   A  single  quote  cannot  appear
     within  the  single quotes.  A single quoted string preceded
     by an unquoted $ is processed as an ANSI-C string except for
     the following:
     \0   Causes the remainder of the string to be ignored.
     \E   Equivalent to the escape character (ascii 033),
     \e   Equivalent to the escape character (ascii 033),
     \cx  Expands to the character control-x.
     \C[.name.]
          Expands to the collating element name.

     Inside double quote marks (""), parameter and  command  sub-
     stitution  occur and \ quotes the characters \, `, ", and $.
     A $ in front of a double quoted string will  be  ignored  in
     the  "C"  or  "POSIX" locale, and may cause the string to be
     replaced by a locale specific string otherwise.  The meaning
     of  $* and $@ is identical when not quoted or when used as a
     variable assignment value or as a file name.  However,  when
     used   as   a   command  argument,  "$*"  is  equivalent  to
     "$1d$2d...", where d is the first character of the IFS vari-
     able,  whereas  "$@" is equivalent to "$1" "$2" ....  Inside
     grave quote marks (``), \ quotes the characters \, `, and $.
     If  the grave quotes occur within double quotes, then \ also
     quotes the character ".

     The special meaning of reserved  words  or  aliases  can  be
     removed  by quoting any character of the reserved word.  The

     recognition of function  names  or  built-in  command  names
     listed below cannot be altered by quoting them.

  Arithmetic Evaluation.
     The shell performs arithmetic evaluation for arithmetic sub-
     stitution, to evaluate an arithmetic command, to evaluate an
     indexed array subscript, and to evaluate  arguments  to  the
     built-in  commands shift and let.  Evaluations are performed
     using double precision floating  point  arithmetic  or  long
     double  precision  floating  point  for systems that provide
     this data type.  Floating point constants follow the  ANSI-C
     programming  language  floating  point conventions.  Integer
     constants follow the  ANSI-C  programming  language  integer
     constant  conventions  although  only  single byte character
     constants are recognized and character casts are not  recog-
     nized.   In  addition  constants can be of the form [base#]n
     where base is a decimal number between  two  and  sixty-four
     representing  the  arithmetic base and n is a number in that
     base.  The digits above 9 are represented by the lower  case
     letters, the upper case letters, @, and _ respectively.  For
     bases less than or equal to 36, upper and lower case charac-
     ters can be used interchangeably.

     An arithmetic expression uses the same  syntax,  precedence,
     and  associativity of expression as the C language.  All the
     C language operators that apply to floating point quantities
     can  be  used.  In addition, the operator ** can be used for
     exponentiation.  It has higher precedence  than  multiplica-
     tion as is left associative.  In addition, when the value of
     an arithmetic variable or sub-expression can be  represented
     as  a long integer, all C language integer arithmetic opera-
     tions can be performed. Variables can be referenced by  name
     within  an arithmetic expression without using the parameter
     expansion syntax.  When a variable is referenced, its  value
     is evaluated as an arithmetic expression.

     The following math library functions can  be  used  with  an
     arithmetic expression:

     abs acos asin atan atan2 cos cosh exp floor fmod  hypot  int
     log pow sin sinh sqrt tan tanh

     An internal representation of a variable as a double  preci-
     sion  floating  point can be specified with the -E [n] or -F
     [n] option of the typeset special built-in command.  The  -E
     option  causes  the expansion of the value to be represented
     using scientific notation when it is expanded.  The optional
     option argument n defines the number of significant figures.
     The -F option causes the expansion to be  represented  as  a
     floating  decimal  number when it is expanded.  The optional
     option argument n defines the number  of  places  after  the
     decimal point in this case.

     An internal integer representation  of  a  variable  can  be
     specified  with  the  -i  [n]  option of the typeset special
     built-in command.  The optional option argument n  specifies
     an  arithmetic  base to be used when expanding the variable.
     If you do not specify an arithmetic base, base  10  will  be
     used.

     Arithmetic evaluation is performed  on  the  value  of  each
     assignment  to  a variable with the -E, -F, or -i attribute.
     Assigning a floating point number to a variable  whose  type
     is an integer causes the fractional part to be truncated.

  Prompting.
     When used interactively, the shell prompts with the value of
     PS1 after expanding it for parameter expansion, command sub-
     stitution, and arithmetic  substitution,  before  reading  a
     command.   In  addition,  each  single  !  in  the prompt is
     replaced by the command number.  A !! is required to place !
     in  the  prompt.   If  at  any  time a new-line is typed and
     further input is needed to  complete  a  command,  then  the
     secondary prompt (i.e., the value of PS2) is issued.

  Conditional Expressions.
     A conditional expression is used with the [[  compound  com-
     mand  to  test  attributes  of files and to compare strings.
     Field splitting and file name generation are  not  performed
     on the words between [[ and ]].  Each expression can be con-
     structed from one or more of the following unary  or  binary
     expressions:
     string
          True, if string is not null.
     -a file
          Same as -e below.  This is obsolete.

          value of their characters.

          True, if string1 comes after  string2  based  on  ASCII
          value of their characters.
     The following obsolete arithmetic comparisons are also  per-
     mitted:
     exp1 -eq exp2
          True, if exp1 is equal to exp2.
     exp1 -ne exp2
          True, if exp1 is not equal to exp2.
     exp1 -lt exp2
          True, if exp1 is less than exp2.
     exp1 -gt exp2
          True, if exp1 is greater than exp2.
     exp1 -le exp2
          True, if exp1 is less than or equal to exp2.
     exp1 -ge exp2
          True, if exp1 is greater than or equal to exp2.

     In each of the above expressions, if file  is  of  the  form
     /dev/fd/n,  where  n is an integer, then the test is applied
     to the open file whose descriptor number is n.

     A compound expression can be constructed from  these  primi-
     tives  by  using  any of the following, listed in decreasing
     order of precedence.
     (expression)
          True, if expression is true.   Used  to  group  expres-
          sions.
     ! expression
          True if expression is false.
     expression1 &amp;&amp; expression2
          True, if expression1 and expression2 are both true.
     expression1 || expression2
          True, if either expression1 or expression2 is true.

  Input/Output.
     Before a command is executed, its input and  output  may  be
     redirected  using  a  special  notation  interpreted  by the
     shell.  The following  may  appear  anywhere  in  a  simple-
     command  or  may  precede  or  follow  a command and are not
     passed on to the  invoked  command.   Command  substitution,

     parameter   expansion,  and  arithmetic  substitution  occur
     before word or digit is used except as  noted  below.   File
     name  generation occurs only if the shell is interactive and
     the pattern matches a single file.  Field splitting  is  not
     performed.

     In each of the following redirections, if  file  is  of  the
     form  /dev/tcp/host/port,  or /dev/udp/host/port, where host
     is a hostname or host address, and port is a  service  given
     by  name  or  an  integer  port number, then the redirection
     attempts to make a tcp or udp connection to the  correspond-
     ing socket.

     No intervening space is allowed between  the  characters  of
     redirection operators.

     &gt;word         Use  file  word  as  standard   output   (file
                   descriptor  1).   If  the  file does not exist
                   then it is created.  If the file  exists,  and
                   the  noclobber  option  is  on, this causes an
                   error; otherwise,  it  is  truncated  to  zero
                   length.

     &gt;&gt;word        Use file word as standard output.  If the file
                   exists,  then  output  is  appended  to it (by
                   first seeking to the end-of-file);  otherwise,

                   input.   If  any  character of word is quoted,
                   then no  interpretation  is  placed  upon  the
                   characters of the document; otherwise, parame-

     &lt;&amp;digit       The standard input  is  duplicated  from  file
                   descriptor  digit (see dup(2)).  Similarly for
                   the standard output using &gt;&amp;digit.

     &lt;&amp;digit-      The file descriptor given by digit is moved to
                   standard  input.   Similarly  for the standard
                   output using &gt;&amp;digit-.

     &lt;&amp;-           The standard input is closed.   Similarly  for
                   the standard output using &gt;&amp;-.

     &lt;&amp;p           The input from  the  co-process  is  moved  to
                   standard input.

     &gt;&amp;p           The output to the co-process is moved to stan-
                   dard output.

     &lt;#            Evaluate arithmetic expression expr and  posi-
                   tion  file descriptor 0 to the resulting value
                   bytes from the start of the file.   The  vari-
                   ables  CUR  and  EOF  evaluate  to the current
                   offset  and  end-of-file  offset  respectively
                   when evaluating expr.

     &gt;#            The same as &lt;# except applies to file descrip-
                   tor 1.

     If one of the above is preceded by a digit, with  no  inter-
     vening space, then the file descriptor number referred to is
     that specified by the digit (instead of the default 0 or 1).
     If one of the above, other than &gt;&amp;- and the &gt;# and &gt;# forms,
     is preceded by {varname} with no intervening space,  then  a
     file  descriptor  number  &gt; 10 will be selected by the shell
     and stored in the variable varname.  If &gt;&amp;- or  the  any  of
     the  &gt;#  and  &gt;# forms is preceded by {varname} the value of
     varname defines the file descriptor to  close  or  position.
     For example:

          ... 2&gt;&amp;1

     means file descriptor 2 is to be opened  for  writing  as  a
     duplicate of file descriptor 1 and

          exec {n}&lt;file

     means open file named file for reading and  store  the  file
     descriptor number in variable n.

     The order in which redirections are  specified  is  signifi-
     cant.   The shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the
     (file descriptor, file) association at the time  of  evalua-
     tion.  For example:

          ... 1&gt;fname 2&gt;&amp;1

     first associates file descriptor 1 with file fname.  It then
     associates  file  descriptor 2 with the file associated with
     file descriptor 1 (i.e.  fname).  If the order  of  redirec-
     tions  were  reversed, file descriptor 2 would be associated
     with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been)  and
     then file descriptor 1 would be associated with file fname.

     If a command is followed by &amp; and job control is not active,
     then the default standard input for the command is the empty
     file /dev/null.  Otherwise, the environment for  the  execu-
     tion  of  a  command  contains  the  file descriptors of the
     invoking shell as modified by input/output specifications.

  Environment.
     The environment (see environ(7)) is  a  list  of  name-value
     pairs  that is passed to an executed program in the same way
     as a normal argument list.  The names  must  be  identifiers
     and  the  values are character strings.  The shell interacts
     with the environment in several ways.   On  invocation,  the
     shell  scans the environment and creates a variable for each
     name found, giving it the corresponding value and attributes
     and  marking  it  export.   Executed  commands  inherit  the
     environment.  If the user modifies the values of these vari-
     ables  or  creates  new ones, using the export or typeset -x
     commands, they become part of the environment.  The environ-
     ment  seen  by  any executed command is thus composed of any
     name-value pairs originally inherited by  the  shell,  whose
     values  may be modified by the current shell, plus any addi-
     tions which must be noted in export or typeset -x commands.

     The environment for any simple-command or  function  may  be
     augmented  by prefixing it with one or more variable assign-
     ments.  A variable assignment argument is a word of the form
     identifier=value.  Thus:

          TERM=450 cmd args                  and
          (export TERM; TERM=450; cmd args)

     are equivalent (as far as the above execution of cmd is con-
     cerned  except  for special built-in commands listed below -
     those that are preceded with a dagger).

     If the obsolete -k option is set,  all  variable  assignment
     arguments  are placed in the environment, even if they occur
     after the command name.  The following first  prints  a=b  c
     and then c:

          echo a=b c
          set -k
          echo a=b c
     This feature is intended for use with  scripts  written  for
     early  versions  of  the shell and its use in new scripts is
     strongly discouraged.  It is likely to disappear someday.

  Functions.
     For historical reasons, there are two ways to  define  func-
     tions,  the  name()  syntax  and  the  function name syntax,
     described in the Commands section  above.   Shell  functions
     are read in and stored internally.  Alias names are resolved
     when the function is read.  Functions are executed like com-
     mands  with  the  arguments passed as positional parameters.
     (See Execution below.)

     Functions defined by the function name syntax and called  by
     name execute in the same process as the caller and share all
     files and present working directory with the caller.   Traps
     caught  by  the  caller  are  reset  to their default action
     inside the function.  A trap condition that is not caught or
     ignored by the function causes the function to terminate and
     the condition to be passed on to the caller.  A trap on EXIT
     set  inside a function is executed in the environment of the
     caller after the function completes.  Ordinarily,  variables
     are  shared  between  the  calling program and the function.
     However, the typeset special built-in command used within  a
     function  defines  local  variables whose scope includes the
     current function.  They can be passed to functions that they
     call  in  the variable assignment list the precedes the call
     or as arguments passed as name  references.   Errors  within
     functions return control to the caller.

     Functions defined  with  the  name()  syntax  and  functions
     defined  with the function name syntax that are invoked with
     the  .   special  built-in  are  executed  in  the  caller's
     environment  and  share  all  variables  and  traps with the
     caller.  Errors within these function executions  cause  the
     script that contains them to abort.

     The special built-in command return is used to  return  from
     function calls.

     Function names can be listed with the -f or +f option of the
     typeset  special  built-in  command.  The text of functions,
     when available, will also be listed with -f.  Functions  can
     be  undefined with the -f option of the unset special built-

User Commands                                              KSH(1)

     in command.

     Ordinarily, functions are unset when the  shell  executes  a
     shell  script.   Functions  that  need  to be defined across
     separate invocations of the shell  should  be  placed  in  a
     directory  and the FPATH variable should contain the name of
     this directory.  They may also be specified in the ENV file.

  Discipline Functions.
     Each variable can have zero  or  more  discipline  functions
     associated  with  it.   The  shell initially understands the
     discipline names get, set, append, and  unset  but  on  most
     systems  others  can be added at run time via the C program-
     ming interface extension provided by  the  builtin  built-in
     utility.   If  the get discipline is defined for a variable,
     it is invoked whenever the given variable is referenced.  If
     the  variable  .sh.value is assigned a value inside the dis-
     cipline function, the referenced variable will  evaluate  to
     this  value instead.  If the set discipline is defined for a
     variable, it is  invoked  whenever  the  given  variable  is
     assigned a value.  If the append discipline is defined for a
     variable, it is invoked whenever a value is appended to  the
     given  variable.   The variable .sh.value is given the value
     of the variable before  invoking  the  discipline,  and  the
     variable  will  be assigned the value of .sh.value after the
     discipline completes.  If .sh.value is unset inside the dis-
     cipline, then that value is unchanged.  If the unset discip-
     line is defined for a variable, it is invoked  whenever  the
     given  variable  is  unset.   The variable will not be unset
     unless it is unset explicitly from  within  this  discipline
     function.

     The variable .sh.name contains the name of the variable  for
     which  the  discipline  function is called, .sh.subscript is
     the subscript of the variable, and  .sh.value  will  contain
     the  value  being  assigned inside the .set discipline func-
     tion.  For  the  set  discipline,  changing  .sh.value  will
     change the value that gets assigned.

  Jobs.
     If the monitor option of the set command is  turned  on,  an
     interactive  shell  associates a job with each pipeline.  It
     keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the jobs  command,
     and  assigns  them  small  integer  numbers.   When a job is
     started asynchronously with &amp;, the shell prints a line which
     looks like:

          [1] 1234

     indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was
     job  number 1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process
     id was 1234.

User Commands                                              KSH(1)

     This paragraph and the next require features that are not in
     all  versions of UNIX and may not apply.  If you are running
     a job and wish to do something else you may hit the  key  ^Z
     (control-Z)  which  sends  a STOP signal to the current job.
     The shell will then normally indicate that the job has  been
     `Stopped',  and  print another prompt.  You can then manipu-
     late the state of this job, putting  it  in  the  background
     with  the  bg  command,  or run some other commands and then
     eventually bring the job back into the foreground  with  the
     foreground command fg.  A ^Z takes effect immediately and is
     like an interrupt in that pending output  and  unread  input
     are discarded when it is typed.

     A job being run in the background will stop if it  tries  to
     read  from  the  terminal.   Background  jobs  are  normally
     allowed to produce output, but this can be disabled by  giv-
     ing  the  command  stty tostop.  If you set this tty option,
     then background jobs will stop when they try to produce out-
     put like they do when they try to read input.

     There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.  A job
     can  be  referred to by the process id of any process of the
     job or by one of the following:
     %number
          The job with the given number.
     %string
          Any job whose command line begins with string.
     %?string
          Any job whose command line contains string.
     %%   Current job.
     %+   Equivalent to %%.
     %-   Previous job.

     The shell learns  immediately  whenever  a  process  changes
     state.   It  normally  informs  you  whenever  a job becomes
     blocked so that no further progress is  possible,  but  only
     just  before  it  prints  a prompt.  This is done so that it
     does not otherwise disturb your work.  The notify option  of
     the  set  command causes the shell to print these job change
     messages as soon as they occur.

     When the monitor option is on, each background job that com-
     pletes triggers any trap set for CHLD.

     When you try to leave the shell while jobs  are  running  or
     stopped,  you will be warned that `You have stopped(running)
     jobs.'  You may use the jobs command to see what  they  are.
     If  you  immediately  try  to exit again, the shell will not
     warn you a second time, and the stopped jobs  will  be  ter-
     minated.  When a login shell receives a HUP signal, it sends
     a HUP signal to each job that has not been disowned with the
     disown built-in command described below.

  Signals.
     The INT and QUIT signals for an invoked command are  ignored
     if  the  command  is followed by &amp; and the monitor option is
     not active.  Otherwise, signals have the values inherited by
     the  shell  from  its parent (but see also the trap built-in
     command below).

  Execution.
     Each time a command is read,  the  above  substitutions  are
     carried out.  If the command name matches one of the Special
     Built-in Commands listed below, it is  executed  within  the
     current shell process.  Next, the command name is checked to
     see if it matches a user defined function.  If it does,  the
     positional  parameters are saved and then reset to the argu-
     ments of the function call.  A function is also executed  in
     the  current  shell process.  When the function completes or
     issues a return, the positional parameter list is  restored.
     For  functions  defined  with  the function name syntax, any
     trap set on EXIT within the function is executed.  The  exit
     value  of  a  function is the value of the last command exe-
     cuted.  If a command name is not a special built-in  command
     or  a  user  defined function, but it is one of the built-in
     commands listed below, it is executed in the  current  shell
     process.

     The shell variable PATH defines  the  search  path  for  the
     directory  containing  the  command.   Alternative directory
     names are separated by a colon (:).   The  default  path  is
     /bin:/usr/bin:  (specifying  /bin, /usr/bin, and the current
     directory in that order).   The  current  directory  can  be
     specified  by  two or more adjacent colons, or by a colon at
     the beginning or end of the path list.  If the command  name
     contains  a /, then the search path is not used.  Otherwise,
     each directory in the path is  searched  for  an  executable
     file  of  the given name that is not a directory.  If found,
     and if the shell determines that there is a built-in version
     of  a command corresponding to a given pathname, this built-
     in is invoked in the current process.  If  found,  and  this
     directory  is also contained in the value of the FPATH vari-
     able, then this  file  is  loaded  into  the  current  shell
     environment  as  if  it  were  the argument to the . command
     except that only preset aliases are expanded, and a function
     of  the  given  name is executed as described above.  If not
     found, and the file .paths is found, and the this file  con-
     tains  a  line  of  the  form FPATH=path where path names an
     existing directory, and this directory contains  a  file  of
     the  given  name,  then this file is loaded into the current
     shell environment as if it were the argument to the  .  spe-
     cial  built-in  command  and a function of the given name is
     executed.  Otherwise, if found, a process is created and  an
     attempt is made to execute the command via exec(2).

     When an executable is found, the directory where it is found
     in  is  searched  for  a file named .paths.  If this file is
     found and it contains a line of the form BUILTIN_LIB=value ,
     then  the  library named by value will be searched for as if
     it were an option argument to builtin -f, and if it contains
     a  built-in  of  the  specified  name  this will be executed
     instead of a command by this name.  Otherwise, if this  file
     is  found  and  it contains a line of the form name=value in
     the first or second line, then the environment variable name
     is  modified  by prepending the directory specified by value
     to the directory list.  If value is not an  absolute  direc-
     tory,  then  it specifies a directory relative to the direc-
     tory that the executable  was  found.   If  the  environment
     variable name does not already exist it will be added to the
     environment list for the specified command.

     If the file has execute permission but is not an a.out file,
     it  is  assumed  to  be a file containing shell commands.  A
     separate shell is spawned  to  read  it.   All  non-exported
     variables  are  removed  in this case.  If the shell command
     file doesn't have read permission, or if the  setuid  and/or
     setgid  bits are set on the file, then the shell executes an
     agent whose job it is to set up the permissions and  execute
     the shell with the shell command file passed down as an open
     file.  A parenthesized command is executed  in  a  sub-shell
     without removing non-exported variables.

  Command Re-entry.
     The text of the last HISTSIZE (default 128) commands entered
     from a terminal device is saved in a history file.  The file
     $HOME/.sh_history is used if the HISTFILE  variable  is  not
     set  or  if  the file it names is not writable.  A shell can
     access the commands of all interactive shells which use  the
     same  named  HISTFILE.  The built-in command hist is used to
     list or edit a portion of this file.   The  portion  of  the
     file  to be edited or listed can be selected by number or by
     giving the first character or characters of the command.   A
     single  command  or  range of commands can be specified.  If
     you do not specify an editor program as an argument to  hist
     then  the  value  of  the  variable  HISTEDIT  is  used.  If
     HISTEDIT is unset, the obsolete variable FCEDIT is used.  If
     FCEDIT  is  not  defined,  then /bin/ed is used.  The edited
     command(s) is printed and re-executed upon leaving the  edi-
     tor  unless you quit without writing.  The -s option (and in
     obsolete versions, the editor name -) is used  to  skip  the
     editing phase and to re-execute the command.  In this case a
     substitution parameter of the form old=new can  be  used  to
     modify  the command before execution.  For example, with the
     preset alias r, which is aliased to  'hist  -s',  typing  `r
     bad=good  c'  will  re-execute the most recent command which
     starts with the letter c, replacing the first occurrence  of
     the string bad with the string good.

  In-line Editing Options.
     Normally, each command line entered from a  terminal  device
     is   simply  typed  followed  by  a  new-line  (`RETURN'  or
     `LINE FEED').  If either the emacs, gmacs, or vi  option  is
     active, the user can edit the command line.  To be in either
     of these edit modes set the corresponding option.  An  edit-
     ing option is automatically selected each time the VISUAL or
     EDITOR variable is assigned a  value  ending  in  either  of
     these option names.

     The editing features require that the user's terminal accept
     `RETURN'  as  carriage  return  without line feed and that a
     space (` ') must overwrite  the  current  character  on  the
     screen.

     Unless the multiline option is on, the editing modes  imple-
     ment a concept where the user is looking through a window at
     the current line.  The window width is the value of  COLUMNS
     if  it is defined, otherwise 80.  If the window width is too
     small to display the prompt and leave at least 8 columns  to
     enter  input, the prompt is truncated from the left.  If the
     line is longer than the window width minus two,  a  mark  is
     displayed  at  the end of the window to notify the user.  As
     the cursor moves and reaches the window boundaries the  win-
     dow  will be centered about the cursor.  The mark is a &gt; (&lt;,
     *) if the line extends on the right (left, both) side(s)  of
     the window.

     The search commands in each edit mode provide access to  the
     history  file.   Only  strings  are  matched,  not patterns,
     although a leading ^ in the string restricts  the  match  to
     begin at the first character in the line.

     Each of the edit modes has an operation to list the files or
     commands  that match a partially entered word.  When applied
     to the first word on the line, or the first word after a  ;,
     |,  &amp;, or (, and the word does not begin with ~ or contain a
     /, the list of aliases, functions, and  executable  commands
     defined  by  the  PATH variable that could match the partial
     word is displayed.  Otherwise, the list of files that  match
     the  given word is displayed.  If the partially entered word
     does not contain any  file  expansion  characters,  a  *  is
     appended  before  generating  these lists.  After displaying
     the generated list, the input line is redrawn.  These opera-
     tions are called command name listing and file name listing,
     respectively.  There are additional operations, referred  to
     as  command  name completion and file name completion, which
     compute the list of matching commands or files, but  instead
     of  printing  the list, replace the current word with a com-
     plete or partial match.  For file name  completion,  if  the
     match  is unique, a / is appended if the file is a directory
     and a space is appended if the  file  is  not  a  directory.

     Otherwise,  the  longest  common prefix for all the matching
     files replaces the word.  For command name completion,  only
     the  portion  of the file names after the last / are used to
     find the longest command prefix.   If  only  a  single  name
     matches this prefix, then the word is replaced with the com-
     mand name followed by a space.

  Key Bindings.
     The KEYBD trap can be used to intercept  keys  as  they  are
     typed  and  change  the characters that are actually seen by
     the shell.  This trap is executed after each  character  (or
     sequence  of  characters when the first character is ESC) is
     entered  while  reading  from  a  terminal.   The   variable
     .sh.edchar  contains  the  character  or  character sequence
     which generated the trap.  Changing the value of  .sh.edchar
     in  the trap action causes the shell to behave as if the new
     value were entered from the keyboard rather than the  origi-
     nal value.

     The variable .sh.edcol is set to the input column number  of
     the   cursor  at  the  time  of  the  input.   The  variable
     .sh.edmode is set to ESC when in vi insert mode (see  below)
     and  is  null otherwise.  By prepending ${.sh.editmode} to a
     value assigned to .sh.edchar it  will  cause  the  shell  to
     change to control mode if it is not already in this mode.

     This trap is not invoked for characters entered as arguments
     to  editing directives, or while reading input for a charac-
     ter search.

  Emacs Editing Mode.
     This mode is entered by enabling either the emacs  or  gmacs
     option.   The only difference between these two modes is the
     way they handle ^T.  To edit, the user moves the  cursor  to
     the  point  needing  correction  and then inserts or deletes
     characters or words as needed.  All the editing commands are
     control  characters  or  escape sequences.  The notation for
     control characters is caret (^) followed by  the  character.
     For  example,  ^F  is  the  notation for control F.  This is
     entered by depressing `f'  while  holding  down  the  `CTRL'
     (control)  key.   The  `SHIFT'  key  is not depressed.  (The
     notation ^? indicates the DEL (delete) key.)

     The notation for escape sequences is M- followed by a  char-
     acter.   For  example, M-f (pronounced Meta f) is entered by
     depressing ESC (ascii 033) followed by `f'.  (M-F  would  be
     the notation for ESC followed by `SHIFT' (capital) `F'.)

     All edit commands operate from any place on  the  line  (not
     just  at the beginning).  Neither the `RETURN' nor the `LINE
     FEED' key is entered after edit commands except when noted.

               deleted  and  one  #  after  each new-line is also
               deleted.

  Vi Editing Mode.
     There are two typing modes.  Initially,  when  you  enter  a
     command you are in the input mode.  To edit, the user enters
     control mode by typing ESC (033) and moves the cursor to the
     point needing correction and then inserts or deletes charac-
     ters or words as needed.  Most control  commands  accept  an
     optional repeat count prior to the command.

     When in vi mode on most  systems,  canonical  processing  is
     initially  enabled  and  the command will be echoed again if
     the speed is 1200 baud or greater and it contains  any  con-
     trol  characters  or  less than one second has elapsed since
     the prompt was printed.  The ESC character terminates canon-
     ical  processing  for  the  remainder of the command and the
     user can then modify the command line.  This scheme has  the
     advantages of canonical processing with the type-ahead echo-
     ing of raw mode.

     If the option viraw is also set, the  terminal  will  always
     have  canonical  processing disabled.  This mode is implicit
     for systems that do not support two alternate  end  of  line
     delimiters, and may be helpful for certain terminals.

       Input Edit Commands
          By default the editor is in input mode.
          erase     (User defined erase character as  defined  by
                    the  stty  command, usually ^H or #.)  Delete
                    previous character.
          ^W        Delete the previous blank separated word.  On
                    some systems the viraw option may be required
                    for this to work.
          eof       As the first character of the line causes the
                    shell   to  terminate  unless  the  ignoreeof
                    option is set.  Otherwise this  character  is
                    ignored.
          ^V        Escape next  character.   Editing  characters
                    and  the  user's erase or kill characters may
                    be entered in a command line or in  a  search
                    string  if  preceded by a ^V.  The ^V removes
                    the next  character's  editing  features  (if
                    any).   On  some systems the viraw option may
                    be required for this to work.

  Built-in Commands.
     The following simple-commands are executed in the shell pro-
     cess.  Input/Output redirection is permitted.  Unless other-
     wise indicated, the output is written on file  descriptor  1
     and the exit status, when there is no syntax error, is zero.
     Except for :, true, false,  echo,  newgrp,  and  login,  all
     built-in  commands  accept  ~--  to  indicate end of options.
     They also interpret the option ~--man as a request to display
     the  man  page  onto standard error and -? as a help request
     which prints a usage message on  standard  error.   Commands
     that  are  preceded  by  one  or  two  - symbols are special
     built-in commands and are treated specially in the following
     ways:
     1.   Variable assignment lists preceding the command  remain
          in effect when the command completes.
     2.   I/O redirections are processed after  variable  assign-
          ments.
     3.   Errors cause a script that contains them to abort.
     4.   They are not valid function names.
     5.   Words following a command preceded by ~--  that  are  in
          the  format  of a variable assignment are expanded with
          the same rules as a variable  assignment.   This  means
          that  tilde  substitution is performed after the = sign
          and field splitting and file name  generation  are  not
          performed.

     - : [ arg ... ]
          The command only expands parameters.

     - . name [ arg ... ]
          If name is a function defined with  the  function  name
          reserved  word  syntax, the function is executed in the
          current environment (as if it had been defined with the
          name()  syntax.)   Otherwise  if name refers to a file,
          the file is read in its entirety and the  commands  are
          executed  in the current shell environment.  The search
          path specified by PATH is used to  find  the  directory
          containing  the  file.  If any arguments arg are given,
          they become the positional parameters while  processing
          the  .  command  and the original positional parameters
          are restored upon completion.  Otherwise the positional
          parameters  are unchanged.  The exit status is the exit
          status of the last command executed.

     ~-- alias [ -ptx ]  [ name[ =value  ] ] ...
          alias with no arguments prints the list of  aliases  in
          the  form name=value on standard output.  The -p option
          causes the word alias to be inserted before  each  one.
          When  one  or  more  arguments  are  given, an alias is
          defined for each name whose value is given.  A trailing
          space  in  value causes the next word to be checked for
          alias substitution.  The obsolete -t option is used  to
          set  and  list tracked aliases.  The value of a tracked
          alias is the full pathname corresponding to  the  given
          name.   The  value  becomes undefined when the value of
          PATH is reset but the alias remains  tracked.   Without
          the  -t  option, for each name in the argument list for
          which no value is given, the  name  and  value  of  the
          alias  is  printed.   The  obsolete  -x  option  has no
          effect.  The exit status  is  non-zero  if  a  name  is
          given,  but no value, and no alias has been defined for
          the name.

     bg [ job... ]
          This command is only on systems that support  job  con-
          trol.   Puts  each  specified  job into the background.
          The current job is put in the background if job is  not
          specified.  See Jobs for a description of the format of
          job.

     - break [ n ]
          Exit from the enclosing for, while,  until,  or  select
          loop, if any.  If n is specified, then break n levels.

     builtin [ -ds ] [ -f file ] [ name ... ]
          If name is not specified, and no -f  option  is  speci-
          fied,  the  built-ins  are  printed on standard output.
          The  -s  option  prints  only  the  special  built-ins.

          Otherwise,  each  name  represents  the  pathname whose
          basename is the name of the built-in.  The entry  point
          function  name  is  determined  by prepending b_ to the
          built-in name.  Special built-ins cannot be bound to  a
          pathname or deleted.  The -d option deletes each of the
          given built-ins.  On systems that support dynamic load-
          ing,  the  -f  option names a shared library containing
          the code for  built-ins.   The  shared  library  prefix
          and/or suffix, which depend on the system, can be omit-
          ted.  Once a library  is  loaded,  its  symbols  become
          available  for subsequent invocations of builtin.  Mul-
          tiple libraries can be specified with separate  invoca-
          tions  of  the builtin command.  Libraries are searched
          in the reverse order in which they are specified.  When
          a  library  is  loaded,  it looks for a function in the
          library whose name is lib_init() and invokes this func-
          tion with an argument of 0.

     cd [ -LP ] [ arg ]
     cd [ -LP ] old new
          This command can be in either of  two  forms.   In  the
          first form it changes the current directory to arg.  If
          arg is - the  directory  is  changed  to  the  previous
          directory.  The shell variable HOME is the default arg.
          The variable PWD is set to the current directory.   The
          shell  variable  CDPATH defines the search path for the
          directory containing arg.  Alternative directory  names
          are  separated  by  a  colon  (:).  The default path is
          &lt;null&gt; (specifying the current directory).   Note  that
          the current directory is specified by a null path name,
          which can appear immediately after the  equal  sign  or
          between  the colon delimiters anywhere else in the path
          list.  If arg begins with a / then the search  path  is
          not  used.   Otherwise,  each  directory in the path is
          searched for arg.
          The second form of cd substitutes the  string  new  for
          the  string old in the current directory name, PWD, and
          tries to change to this new directory.
          By default, symbolic link names are  treated  literally
          when finding the directory name.  This is equivalent to
          the -L option.  The -P option causes symbolic links  to
          be  resolved  when determining the directory.  The last
          instance of -L or -P on  the  command  line  determines
          which method is used.
          The cd command may not be executed by rksh.

     command [ -pvxV ] name [ arg ... ]
          Without the -v or -V  options,  command  executes  name
          with  the arguments given by arg.  The -p option causes
          a default path to  be  searched  rather  than  the  one
          defined  by  the  value of PATH.  Functions will not be
          searched for when finding name.  In addition,  if  name

          refers  to a special built-in, none of the special pro-
          perties associated with the  leading  daggers  will  be
          honored.     (For   example,   the   predefined   alias
          redirect='command exec' prevents  a  script  from  ter-
          minating  when  an invalid redirection is given.)  With
          the -x option, if command execution would result  in  a
          failure  because  there  are  too many arguments, errno
          E2BIG, the shell  will  invoke  command  name  multiple
          times  with  a  subset of the arguments on each invoca-
          tion.  Arguments that occur prior  to  the  first  word
          that  expands  to multiple arguments and after the last
          word that expands to multiple arguments will be  passed
          on  each  invocation.  The exit status will be the max-
          imum invocation exit status.  With the -v option,  com-
          mand  is  equivalent  to  the  built-in  whence command
          described below.  The -V option causes command  to  act
          like whence -v.

     - continue [ n ]
          Resume the next iteration of the enclosing for,  while,
          until,  or select loop.  If n is specified, then resume
          at the n-th enclosing loop.

     disown [ job... ]
          Causes the shell not to send a HUP signal to each given
          job, or all active jobs if job is omitted, when a login
          shell terminates.

     echo [ arg ... ]
          When the first arg does not begin with a -, and none of
          the arguments contain a \, then echo prints each of its
          arguments separated by a  space  and  terminated  by  a
          new-line.   Otherwise,  the  behavior of echo is system
          dependent and print or printf described below should be
          used.  See echo(1) for usage and description.

     - eval [ arg ... ]
          The arguments are read as input to the  shell  and  the
          resulting command(s) executed.

     - exec [ -c ] [ -a name ] [ arg ... ]
          If arg is given, the command specified by the arguments
          is  executed  in place of this shell without creating a
          new process.  The -c option causes the  environment  to
          be cleared before applying variable assignments associ-
          ated with the exec invocation.  The  -a  option  causes
          name  rather  than the first arg, to become argv[0] for
          the new process.  Input/output arguments may appear and
          affect  the  current process.  If arg is not given, the
          effect of this command is to modify file descriptors as
          prescribed  by  the  input/output redirection list.  In
          this case, any file descriptor numbers greater  than  2

     - exit [ n ]
          Causes the shell to exit with the exit status specified
          by  n.   The value will be the least significant 8 bits
          of the specified status.  If n  is  omitted,  then  the
          exit  status  is that of the last command executed.  An
          end-of-file will also cause the shell  to  exit  except
          for  a  shell  which  has the ignoreeof option (see set
          below) turned on.

     ~-- export [ -p ] [ name[=value] ] ...
          If name is not given, the  names  and  values  of  each
          variable with the export attribute are printed with the
          values quoted in a manner that allows them  to  be  re-
          input.   The  -p  option  causes  the word export to be
          inserted before each one.  Otherwise, the  given  names
          are  marked  for automatic export to the environment of
          subsequently-executed commands.

     false
          Does nothing, and exits 1. Used with until for infinite
          loops.

     fg [ job... ]
          This command is only on systems that support  job  con-
          trol.   Each job specified is brought to the foreground
          and waited for in the specified order.  Otherwise,  the
          current  job  is brought into the foreground.  See Jobs
          for a description of the format of job.

     getconf [ name [ pathname ] ]
          Prints the current value of the configuration parameter
          given   by  name.   The  configuration  parameters  are
          defined by the IEEE POSIX 1003.1 and IEEE POSIX  1003.2
          standards.   (See  pathconf(2)  and  sysconf(2).)   The
          pathname argument  is  required  for  parameters  whose
          value  depends  on the location in the file system.  If
          no arguments are given, getconf prints  the  names  and
          values  of  the  current configuration parameters.  The
          pathname / is used for  each  of  the  parameters  that
          requires pathname.

     getopts [  -a name ] optstring vname [ arg ... ]
          Checks arg for legal options.  If arg is  omitted,  the
          positional  parameters  are  used.   An option argument
          begins with a + or a -.  An option not beginning with +
          or  -  or  the  argument  ~-- ends the options.  Options
          beginning with + are  only  recognized  when  optstring
          begins  with  a +.  optstring contains the letters that
          getopts recognizes.  If a letter is followed  by  a  :,

          that  option  is  expected  to  have  an argument.  The
          options can be separated from the argument  by  blanks.
          The  option  -? causes getopts to generate a usage mes-
          sage on standard error.  The -a argument can be used to
          specify  the  name  to use for the usage message, which
          defaults to $0.
          getopts places the next option letter it  finds  inside
          variable  vname  each  time  it is invoked.  The option
          letter will be prepended with a + when arg begins  with
          a  +.   The  index of the next arg is stored in OPTIND.
          The option argument, if any, gets stored in OPTARG.
          A leading : in optstring causes getopts  to  store  the
          letter of an invalid option in OPTARG, and to set vname
          to ? for an unknown option and to  :  when  a  required
          option  argument is missing.  Otherwise, getopts prints
          an error message.  The exit  status  is  non-zero  when
          there are no more options.
          There is no way to specify any of the options :, +,  -,
          ?, [, and ].  The option # can only be specified as the
          first option.

     hist [ -e ename  ] [ -nlr ] [ first [ last ] ]
     hist -s  [ old=new ] [ command ]
          In the first form, a range of commands  from  first  to
          last  is  selected from the last HISTSIZE commands that
          were typed at the terminal.  The  arguments  first  and
          last  may  be  specified as a number or as a string.  A
          string is used to locate the most recent command start-
          ing  with  the given string.  A negative number is used
          as an offset to the current command number.  If the  -l
          option is selected, the commands are listed on standard
          output.  Otherwise, the editor program ename is invoked
          on a file containing these keyboard commands.  If ename
          is  not  supplied,  then  the  value  of  the  variable
          HISTEDIT  is used.  If HISTEDIT is not set, then FCEDIT
          (default /bin/ed) is used as the editor.  When  editing
          is  complete,  the edited command(s) is executed if the
          changes have been saved.  If  last  is  not  specified,
          then  it  will be set to first.  If first is not speci-
          fied, the default is the previous command  for  editing
          and  -16 for listing.  The option -r reverses the order
          of the commands and the option  -n  suppresses  command
          numbers  when  listing.  In the second form, command is
          interpreted as first described above  and  defaults  to
          the  last  command  executed.  The resulting command is
          executed after the  optional  substitution  old=new  is
          performed.

          option  only  displays jobs that have stopped or exited
          since last notified.  The -p  option  causes  only  the
          process group to be listed.  See Jobs for a description
          of the format of job.

     kill [ -s signame ] job ...
     kill [ -n signum ] job ...
     kill -l [ sig ... ]
          Sends either the TERM (terminate) signal or the  speci-
          fied  signal  to the specified jobs or processes.  Sig-
          nals are either given by number with the -n  option  or
          by  name  with  the  -s option (as given in &lt;signal.h&gt;,
          stripped of the prefix ``SIG'' with the exception  that
          SIGCLD is named CHLD).  For backward compatibility, the
          n and s can be omitted and the number  or  name  placed
          immediately  after  the -.  If the signal being sent is
          TERM (terminate) or HUP (hangup), then the job or  pro-
          cess  will  be  sent  a CONT (continue) signal if it is
          stopped.  The argument job can be the process id  of  a
          process that is not a member of one of the active jobs.
          See Jobs for a description of the format  of  job.   In
          the  third  form, kill -l, if sig is not specified, the
          signal names are listed.  Otherwise, for each sig  that
          is  a  name, the corresponding signal number is listed.
          For  each  sig  that  is  a  number,  the  signal  name
          corresponding to the least significant 8 bits of sig is
          listed.

     let arg ...
          Each arg is a  separate  arithmetic  expression  to  be
          evaluated.   See  Arithmetic  Evaluation  above,  for a
          description of arithmetic expression evaluation.
          The exit status is 0 if the value of the  last  expres-
          sion is non-zero, and 1 otherwise.

     - newgrp [ arg ... ]
          Equivalent to exec /bin/newgrp arg ....

     print [ -Renprs ] [ -u unit] [ -f format ] [ arg ... ]
          With no options or with option - or  ~--,  each  arg  is
          printed  on  standard output.  The -f option causes the
          arguments to be printed as  described  by  printf.   In
          this  case, any e, n, r, R options are ignored.  Other-
          wise, unless the -R or -r, are specified, the following
          escape conventions will be applied:
          \a   The alert character (ascii 07).
          \b   The backspace character (ascii 010).
          \c   Causes print to end without processing more  argu-
               ments and not adding a new-line.
          \f   The formfeed character (ascii 014).
          \n   The new-line character (ascii 012).
          \r   The carriage return character (ascii 015).

          \t   The tab character (ascii 011).
          \v   The vertical tab character (ascii 013).
          \E   The escape character (ascii 033).
          \\   The backslash character \.
          \0x  The character defined by  the  1,  2,  or  3-digit
               octal string given by x.

          The -R option will print all subsequent  arguments  and
          options  other than -n.  The -e causes the above escape
          conventions to be applied This is the default behavior.
          It reverses the effect of an earlier -r.  The -p option
          causes the arguments to be written onto the pipe of the
          process  spawned  with  |&amp;  instead of standard output.
          The -s option causes the arguments to be  written  onto
          the  history  file  instead of standard output.  The -u
          option can be used to specify a one digit file descrip-
          tor  unit  number  unit  on  which  the  output will be
          placed.  The default is 1.  If the option -n  is  used,
          no new-line is added to the output.

     printf format [ arg ... ]
          The arguments arg are printed  on  standard  output  in
          accordance  with the ANSI-C formatting rules associated
          with the format string format.  If the number of  argu-
          ments  exceeds the number of format specifications, the
          format string is reused to format remaining  arguments.
          The following extensions can also be used:  A %b format
          can be used instead of %s to cause escape sequences  in
          the  corresponding  arg  to be expanded as described in
          print.  A %B option causes each of the arguments to  be
          treated as variable names and the binary value of vari-
          able will be printed. This is most useful for variables
          whose attribute is -b.  A %H format can be used instead
          of %s to cause characters in arg that  are  special  in
          HTML  and XML to be output to be output as their entity
          name.  A %P format can be used instead of %s  to  cause
          arg to be interpreted as an extended regular expression
          and be printed as a shell pattern.  A %R format can  be
          used  instead of %s to cause arg interpreted as a shell
          pattern and  to  be  printed  as  an  extended  regular
          expression.   A  %q format can be used instead of %s to
          cause the resulting string to be  quoted  in  a  manner
          than  can  be  reinput to the shell.  A %(date-format)T
          format can be use to treat an argument as  a  date/time
          string  and  to  format  the date/time according to the
          date-format as defined for the date(1) command.   A  %Z
          format will output a byte whose value is 0.  The preci-
          sion field of the %d format can be followed by a .  and
          the output base.

          The  -L  option  is  the default; it prints the logical
          name of the current directory.  If  the  -P  option  is
          given,  all  symbolic links are resolved from the name.
          The last instance of -L  or  -P  on  the  command  line
          determines which method is used.

unit] [ vname?prompt ] [ vname ... ]
     read [ -Aprs ] [ -d delim] [ -n n] [ [ -N n] [ [ -t timeout] [ -u
          The  shell  input  mechanism.   One line is read and is
          broken up into fields using the characters  in  IFS  as
          separators.  The escape character, \, is used to remove
          any special meaning for the next character and for line
          continuation.   The  -d  option causes the read to con-
          tinue to the first character of delim rather than  new-
          line.   The  -n  option  causes at most n bytes to read
          rather a full line but will return when reading from  a
          slow  device  as soon as any characters have been read.
          The -N option causes exactly n to  be  read  unless  an
          end-of-file  has been encountered or the read times out
          because of the -t option.  In raw mode, -r, the \ char-
          acter  is  not  treated  specially.  The first field is
          assigned to the first vname, the second  field  to  the
          second  vname,  etc.,  with leftover fields assigned to
          the last vname.  When vname has  the  binary  attribute
          and  -n or -N is specified, the bytes that are read are
          stored directly  into  the  variable.   The  -A  option
          causes  the  variable  vname to be unset and each field
          that is read to be stored in successive elements of the
          indexed  array  vname.   The -p option causes the input
          line to be taken from  the  input  pipe  of  a  process
          spawned  by  the  shell  using |&amp;.  If the -s option is
          present, the input will be saved as a  command  in  the
          history  file.   The option -u can be used to specify a
          one digit file descriptor unit unit to read from.   The
          file  descriptor  can  be  opened with the exec special
          built-in command.  The default value of unit  n  is  0.
          The  option  -t is used to specify a timeout in seconds
          when reading from a terminal  or  pipe.   If  vname  is
          omitted,  then  REPLY is used as the default vname.  An
          end-of-file with the -p option causes cleanup for  this
          process  so  that another can be spawned.  If the first
          argument contains a ?, the remainder of  this  word  is
          used  as  a  prompt on standard error when the shell is
          interactive.  The exit status is 0  unless  an  end-of-
          file is encountered or read has timed out.

     ~-- readonly [ -p ] [ vname[=value] ] ...
          If vname is not given, the names  and  values  of  each
          variable  with  the  readonly attribute is printed with
          the values quoted in a manner that allows  them  to  be
          re-inputted.  The -p option causes the word readonly to
          be inserted before  each  one.   Otherwise,  the  given

          vnames  are  marked  readonly and these names cannot be
          changed by subsequent assignment.

     - return [ n ]
          Causes a shell function or  script  to  return  to  the
          invoking  script  with  the exit status specified by n.
          The value will be the least significant 8 bits  of  the
          specified  status.   If  n  is omitted, then the return
          status is that of the last command executed.  If return
          is invoked while not in a function or a script, then it
          behaves the same as exit.

[ arg ... ]
     - set [ _CGabefhkmnopstuvx ] [ _o [ option ] ] ... [ _A  vname  ]
          The options for this command have meaning as follows:
          -A      Array assignment.  Unset the variable vname and
                  assign  values  sequentially from the arg list.
                  If +A is used, the variable vname is not  unset
                  first.
          -B      Enable brace pattern field generation.  This is
                  the default behavior.
          -C      Prevents redirection &gt; from truncating existing
                  files.   Files that are created are opened with
                  the O_EXCL mode.  Requires  &gt;|  to  truncate  a
                  file when turned on.
          -G      Causes the pattern ** by itself to match  files
                  and   zero   or   more   directories  and  sub-
                  directories when used for file name generation.
                  If  followed  by  a / only directories and sub-
                  directories are matched.
          -a      All subsequent variables that are  defined  are

                  background  job changes state rather than wait-
                  ing for the next prompt.

          with appropriate quoting.  Otherwise,  action  will  be
          processed  as  if  it were an argument to eval when the
          shell receives signal(s) sig.  Each sig can be given as
          a  number  or as the name of the signal.  Trap commands
          are executed in order of signal number.  Any attempt to
          set a trap on a signal that was ignored on entry to the
          current shell is ineffective.  If action is omitted and
          the  first sig is a number, or if action is -, then the
          trap(s) for  each  sig  are  reset  to  their  original
          values.   If action is the null string then this signal
          is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.
          If  sig  is ERR then action will be executed whenever a
          command has a non-zero exit status.  If  sig  is  DEBUG
          then  action will be executed before each command.  The
          variable .sh.command will contain the contents  of  the
          current command line when action is running.  If sig is
          0 or EXIT and the trap statement is executed inside the
          body  of a function defined with the function name syn-
          tax, then the command  action  is  executed  after  the
          function completes.  If sig is 0 or EXIT for a trap set
          outside any function then the command  action  is  exe-
          cuted  on  exit  from the shell.  If sig is KEYBD, then
          action will be executed whenever a key is read while in
          emacs,  gmacs,  or  vi  mode.  The trap command with no
          arguments prints a list  of  commands  associated  with
          each signal number.

     true Does nothing, and exits 0. Used with while for infinite
          loops.

     ~-- typeset [ _AHflbnprtux ] [ _EFLRZi[n] ]  [ vname[=value  ]   ]
          Sets  attributes  and  values  for  shell variables and
          functions.  When invoked inside a function defined with
          the  function  name syntax, a new instance of the vari-
          able vname is created, and  the  variable's  value  and
          type  are  restored  when  the function completes.  The
          following list of attributes may be specified:
          -A   Declares vname to be an associative  array.   Sub-
               scripts are strings rather than arithmetic expres-
               sions.
          -E   Declares vname to be a double  precision  floating
               point  number.   If  n is non-zero, it defines the
               number of significant figures that are  used  when
               expanding  vname.  Otherwise, ten significant fig-
               ures will be used.
          -F   Declares vname to be a double  precision  floating
               point  number.   If  n is non-zero, it defines the
               number of places after the decimal point that  are
               used  when  expanding vname.  Otherwise ten places
               after the decimal point will be used.
          -H   This option provides UNIX to host-name  file  map-
               ping on non-UNIX machines.

               If  n  is  non-zero,  it  defines the width of the
               field, otherwise it is determined by the width  of
               the  value of first assignment.  When the variable
               is assigned to, it is filled  on  the  right  with
               blanks or truncated, if necessary, to fit into the
               field.  The -R option is turned off.
          -R   Right justify and fill with leading blanks.  If  n
               is  non-zero,  it  defines the width of the field,
               otherwise it is determined by  the  width  of  the
               value  of  first  assignment.   The  field is left
               filled with blanks or truncated from  the  end  if
               the  variable  is  reassigned.   The  -L option is
               turned off.
          -Z   Right justify and fill with leading zeros  if  the
               first  non-blank  character  is a digit and the -L
               option has not been set.  Remove leading zeros  if
               the  -L  option is also set.  If n is non-zero, it
               defines the width of the field,  otherwise  it  is
               determined  by  the  width  of  the value of first
               assignment.
          -f   The names refer  to  function  names  rather  than
               variable  names.   No  assignments can be made and
               the only other valid options are -t,  -u  and  -x.
               The  -t option turns on execution tracing for this
               function.  The -u option causes this  function  to
               be  marked  undefined.  The FPATH variable will be
               searched to find the function definition when  the
               function  is referenced.  If no options other than
               -f is specified, then the function definition will
               be  displayed on standard output.  If +f is speci-
               fied, then a line  containing  the  function  name
               followed  by  a  shell comment containing the line
               number and path name of the file where this  func-
               tion was defined, if any, is displayed.
          -b   The variable can hold any number of bytes of data.
               The  data  can  be  text  or binary.  The value is
               represented by the base64 encoding  of  the  data.
               If  -Z is also specified, the size in bytes of the
               data in the buffer will be determined by the  size
               associated  with  the  -Z.   If  the base64 string
               assigned results in more data, it  will  be  trun-
               cated.   Otherwise,  it  will be filled with bytes
               whose value is zero.  The printf format %B can  be
               used  to  output  the  actual  data in this buffer
               instead of the base64 encoding of the data.
          -i   Declares vname to  be  represented  internally  as
               integer.   The right hand side of an assignment is
               evaluated as an arithmetic expression when assign-
               ing  to  an integer.  If n is non-zero, it defines
               the output arithmetic base, otherwise  the  output
               base will be ten.

          -l   All upper-case characters are converted to  lower-
               case.  The upper-case option, -u, is turned off.
          -n   Declares vname to be a reference to  the  variable
               whose  name  is  defined  by the value of variable
               vname.  This is usually used to reference a  vari-
               able  inside a function whose name has been passed
               as an argument.
          -r   The given vnames are  marked  readonly  and  these
               names cannot be changed by subsequent assignment.
          -t   Tags the variables.  Tags are user  definable  and
               have no special meaning to the shell.
          -u   All lower-case characters are converted to  upper-
               case.  The lower-case option, -l, is turned off.
          -x   The given vnames are marked for  automatic  export
               to  the  environment of subsequently-executed com-
               mands.  Variables whose names contain a .   cannot
               be exported.

          The -i attribute cannot be specified along with -R, -L,
          -Z, or -f.

          Using + rather than - causes these options to be turned
          off.  If no vname arguments are given, a list of vnames
          (and  optionally  the  values)  of  the  variables   is
          printed.   (Using + rather than - keeps the values from
          being printed.)  The -p option causes typeset  followed
          by  the  option  letters to be printed before each name
          rather than the names of the options.   If  any  option
          other than -p is given, only those variables which have
          all of the given options are printed.   Otherwise,  the
          vnames and attributes of all variables that have attri-
          butes are printed.

     ulimit [ -HSacdfmnpstv ] [ limit ]
          Set  or  display  a  resource  limit.   The   available
          resource  limits are listed below.  Many systems do not
          support one or more of these limits.  The limit  for  a
          specified resource is set when limit is specified.  The
          value of limit can be a number in  the  unit  specified
          below  with each resource, or the value unlimited.  The
          -H and -S options specify whether the hard limit or the
          soft limit for the given resource is set.  A hard limit
          cannot be increased once it is set.  A soft  limit  can
          be  increased  up  to  the value of the hard limit.  If
          neither the H nor S options  is  specified,  the  limit
          applies to both.  The current resource limit is printed
          when limit is omitted.  In this case, the soft limit is
          printed  unless  H  is  specified.   When more than one
          resource is specified, then the limit name and unit  is
          printed before the value.
          -a   Lists all of the current resource limits.

          -d   The number of K-bytes on  the  size  of  the  data

          -f   The number of 512-byte blocks on files that can be

               processes (files of any size may be read).

          -p   The number of 512-byte blocks for pipe buffering.
          -s   The number of K-bytes on the  size  of  the  stack
               area.
          -t   The number of CPU seconds to be used by each  pro-
               cess.

          If no option is given, -f is assumed.

     umask [ -S ] [ mask ]
          The  user  file-creation  mask  is  set  to  mask  (see
          umask(2)).   mask  can  either  be an octal number or a
          symbolic value as described in chmod(1).  If a symbolic
          value  is  given, the new umask value is the complement
          of the result of applying mask to the complement of the
          previous  umask value.  If mask is omitted, the current
          value of the mask is printed.  The -S option causes the
          mode to be printed as a symbolic value.  Otherwise, the
          mask is printed in octal.

     - unalias [ -a ] name ...
          The aliases given by the list of names are removed from
          the  alias  list.  The -a option causes all the aliases
          to be unset.

     -unset [ -fnv ] vname ...
          The variables given by the list  of  vnames  are  unas-
          signed,  i.e.,  their values and attributes are erased.
          Readonly variables cannot be unset.  If the  -f  option
          is set, then the names refer to function names.  If the
          -v option is set, then  the  names  refer  to  variable
          names.   The  -f option overrides -v.  If -n is set and
          name is a name  reference,  then  name  will  be  unset
          rather  than  the  variable  that  it  references.  The
          default is equivalent to -v.  Unsetting  LINENO,  MAIL-
          CHECK,  OPTARG,  OPTIND,  RANDOM, SECONDS, TMOUT, and _
          removes their special meaning even if they  are  subse-

          For each name, indicate how it would be interpreted  if

          The -v option produces a more verbose report.   The  -f
          options  skips the search for functions.  The -p option
          does a path search for name even if name is an alias, a
          function, or a reserved word.  The -a option is similar
          to the -v option but causes all interpretations of  the
          given name to be reported.

  Invocation.
     If the shell is invoked by exec(2), and the first  character
     of  argument zero ($0) is -, then the shell is assumed to be
     a login shell and commands are read  from  /etc/profile  and
     then  from  either  .profile  in  the  current  directory or
     $HOME/.profile, if either file exists.  Next,  for  interac-
     tive  shells,  commands are read from the file named by per-
     forming  parameter  expansion,  command  substitution,   and
     arithmetic  substitution  on  the  value  of the environment
     variable ENV if the file exists.  If the -s  option  is  not
     present and arg and a file by the name of arg exits, then it
     reads and executes this script.  Otherwise, if the first arg
     does  not  contain  a  /,  a path search is performed on the
     first arg to determine the name of the  script  to  execute.
     The  script  arg must have execute permission and any setuid
     and setgid settings will be ignored.  If the script  is  not
     found  on the path, arg is processed as if it named a built-
     in command or function.  Commands are then read as described
     below;  the  following  options are interpreted by the shell
     when it is invoked:

     -c        If the -c option is  present,  then  commands  are
               read  from the first arg.  Any remaining arguments
               become positional parameters starting at 0.
     -s        If the -s option is present  or  if  no  arguments
               remain,  then  commands are read from the standard
               input.  Shell output, except for the output of the
               Special  Commands listed above, is written to file
               descriptor 2.
     -i        If the -i option is present or if the shell  input
               and  output are attached to a terminal (as told by
               tcgetattr(2)), then this shell is interactive.  In
               this case TERM is ignored (so that kill 0 does not
               kill an interactive shell) and INTR is caught  and
               ignored  (so  that wait is interruptible).  In all
               cases, QUIT is ignored by the shell.
     -r        If the -r option is present, the shell is  a  res-
               tricted shell.

     -D        A list of all double quoted strings that are  pre-
               ceded  by  a  $ will be printed on standard output
               and the shell will exit.  This set of strings will
               be subject to language translation when the locale
               is not C or POSIX.  No commands will be executed.

     -P        If -P or -o profile is present,  the  shell  is  a
               profile shell (see pfexec(1)).

     -R filename
               The -R filename option is used to generate a cross
               reference  database that can be used by a separate
               utility to find  definitions  and  references  for
               variables and commands.

     The remaining options and arguments are described under  the
     set  command  above.  An optional - as the first argument is
     ignored.

  Rksh Only.
     Rksh is used to set up login names  and  execution  environ-
     ments  whose  capabilities are more controlled than those of
     the standard shell.  The actions of rksh  are  identical  to
     those of ksh, except that the following are disallowed:
          changing directory (see cd(1)),
          setting or unsetting the value or attributes of  SHELL,
          ENV, FPATH, or PATH,
          specifying path or command names containing /,
          redirecting output (&gt;, &gt;|, &lt;&gt;, and &gt;&gt;).
          adding or deleting built-in commands.
          using command -p to invoke a command.

     The restrictions above are enforced after .profile  and  the
     ENV files are interpreted.

     When a command to be executed is found to be  a  shell  pro-
     cedure,  rksh invokes ksh to execute it.  Thus, it is possi-
     ble to provide to the end-user shell  procedures  that  have
     access to the full power of the standard shell, while impos-
     ing a limited menu of commands; this scheme assumes that the
     end-user  does not have write and execute permissions in the
     same directory.

     The net effect of these rules is  that  the  writer  of  the
     .profile has complete control over user actions, by perform-
     ing guaranteed setup actions and  leaving  the  user  in  an
     appropriate directory (probably not the login directory).

     The system administrator often sets up a directory  of  com-
     mands (e.g., /usr/rbin) that can be safely invoked by rksh.

EXIT STATUS
     Errors detected by the shell, such as syntax  errors,  cause
     the shell to return a non-zero exit status.  If the shell is
     being used non-interactively, then execution  of  the  shell
     file  is abandoned unless the error occurs inside a subshell
     in which case the subshell  is  abandoned.   Otherwise,  the
     shell  returns  the exit status of the last command executed
     (see also the exit command above).  Run time errors detected
     by  the  shell are reported by printing the command or func-
     tion name and the error condition.  If the line number  that
     the  error  occurred  on  is greater than one, then the line
     number is also printed in square  brackets  ([])  after  the
     command or function name.

CAVEATS
     If a command is executed, and then a command with  the  same
     name  is  installed in a directory in the search path before
     the directory where the  original  command  was  found,  the
     shell  will  continue to exec the original command.  Use the
     -t option of the alias command to correct this situation.

     Some very old shell scripts contain a ^ as a synonym for the
     pipe character |.

     Using the hist built-in command within  a  compound  command
     will  cause  the whole command to disappear from the history
     file.

     The built-in command . file reads the whole file before  any
     commands   are   executed.   Therefore,  alias  and  unalias

User Commands                                              KSH(1)

     commands in the file will not apply to any commands  defined
     in the file.

     Traps are not processed while a job is waiting for  a  fore-
     ground  process.   Thus,  a  trap  on CHLD won't be executed
     until the foreground job terminates.

     It is a good idea to leave a space after the comma  operator
     in  arithmetic  expressions  to prevent the comma from being
     interpreted  as  the  decimal  point  character  in  certain
     locales.
