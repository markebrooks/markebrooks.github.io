There is no explicit "edit" step required by Mercurial.</p><p>Mercurial does not lock files in your workspace for editing, and Cadmium (a Mercurial extension providing wx-like functionality, useful for OpenSolaris development) does not make use of a statically maintained list of changed files (as <strong>wx</strong>(1) would). You can make changes freely in your workspace without any required bookkeeping.</p><p>The hg status command will tell you what you have changed in your repository.</p><h3 id="HCommityourchanges"><span>Commit your changes</span></h3><p>You may commit changes as and when you choose, as with TeamWare a commit is local to a repository until you choose to push it to others.</p><p>For small fixes you may choose to only commit when you're done with your work, or perhaps prior to a merge before you file your RTI.</p><p>For larger workspaces it's generally best to commit at appropriate intervals in your work.</p><p>Cadmium's hg backup command (described below) is not really intended to return you to a point-in-time snapshot of your ongoing work, but to recover a lost (or destroyed) workspace. It is recommended that you move around within your workspace's history using the hg update command to move to prior revisions as necessary. You should do this with both the main and usr/closed repositories at the same time, of course.</p><h3 id="HCheckfornits"><span>Check for nits</span></h3><p>As with <strong>wx</strong>(1), Cadmium provides a command that will run a sub-set of the pre-putback checks on your workspace. You may find it useful to run hg nits (cf. wx nits) at intervals to keep your changes generally tidy as you work. Remember that Cadmium does not cross Mercurial repository boundaries, so must run this separately for usr/closed.</p><p>This will check CDDL blocks, copyrights, C style, header format, Java style, permissions, and (absence of) keywords.</p><h3 id="HBackupyourwork"><span>Backup your work</span></h3><p>You'll want to backup your work at regular intervals, in case of disaster (disk failure, plagues of beetles, possession by the demons of stupidity, and such).</p><p>hg backup will save the changes (both committed and uncommitted) in the working copy of &lt;your-repo&gt; to a subdirectory named &lt;your-repo&gt; in the cdm.backup directory within your home directory, by default.</p><p>As stated above (see "Commit your changes"), these commands do not cross repository boundaries, so you must take separate backups for usr/closed, if appropriate.</p><p>When backing up usr/closed, the backup will be named &lt;your-repo&gt;-closed, so, for instance:</p><pre>
your-repo -&gt; ~/cdm.backup/your-ws
your-repo/usr/closed -&gt; ~/cdm.backup/your-ws-closed
</pre><p>hg backup takes a -t flag which, like wx, will only take a backup if changes have been made since the most recent. Backups are ordered by generation number (a monotonically increasing digit).</p><p>To restore your workspace, clone the parent and restore from your backup:</p><pre>
your-machine:.../your-repo% hg backup
your-machine:~% hg clone ssh://machine//your-parent your-repo-restore
your-machine:~% cd your-repo-restore
your-machine:.../your-repo-restore% hg restore ~/cdm.backup/your-repo
</pre><p>you will need to restore usr/closed separately, if appropriate.</p><p>hg restore takes a -g flag with which you can specify the generation from which you want to restore.</p><h3 id="HMergingwiththeparent"><span>Merging with the parent</span></h3><p>Unlike TeamWare, Mercurial merges the lines of history, rather than only file contents. Therefore, you will need to perform merges <em>even if</em> there are no conflicting file changes (though the merges will be simple then, of course).</p><p>This will no doubt come as a shock, initially.</p><p>You should always update and merge usr/closed in conjunction with merging the rest of your workspace.</p><p>By default, if your .hgrc was configured with <strong>hgsetup</strong>(1), we will default to use TeamWare's <strong>filemerge</strong>(1) for merges, if TeamWare is in your $PATH, and meld or gpyfm if it is not, and you have one of them.</p><h4 id="HMergingwithcommittedchanges"><span>Merging with committed changes</span></h4><p>If your workspace has committed changes, and you pull from your parent workspace, you will likely find that you now have two "heads" (revisions with no children) in your workspace, and that you received output from Mercurial suggesting that you may wish to merge them with hg merge. You almost certainly do.</p><pre>

</pre><p>When you run the hg merge command, Mercurial will merge the two heads, starting your merge application as necessary to resolve content changes in individual files, and asking you questions as necessary to resolve name changes. When complete, your working copy will represent the <em>still uncommitted</em> merge.</p><p>You should commit your merge soon after you are finished performing it, perhaps after some verification that you merged correctly.</p><h4 id="HMergingwithuncommittedchanges"><span>Merging with uncommitted changes</span></h4><p>If you have uncommitted changes in your workspace, you will also need to merge when you use hg pull -u or hg pull &amp;&amp; hg update to update your workspace.</p><p>If the pull added two heads, it means you have both committed and uncommited changes in your repository. In this case, your changes will be as they were, and you may continue working in that state until you see fit to commit, and then hg merge to merge with the extra head.</p><p>If you have <em>only</em> uncommitted changes in your respository, then there is no need to merge the history of your workspace and its parent. In this case, hg update (or the -u part of hg pull -u) will behave similarly to the resolution of a regular merge; your merge application will be start, or you might be asked questions about name conflicts.</p><pre>

This keeps a clear distinction between each change and makes it easy to backout a specific change if required.</p><h5 id="HAlwayscommityourworkbeforeyoumerge."><span>Always commit your work before you merge.</span></h5><p>As we've seen above, if updating your workspace from its parent would cause their histories to diverge, then you will need to merge your changes with the parent. You should commit your changes to your workspace before doing the merge, such that your merge changeset is entirely separate from any ongoing work in your workspace.</p><h3 id="HRecommittingyourworkintoasinglechangeset"><span>Recommitting your work into a single changeset</span></h3><p>As with TeamWare, you may not integrate your changes into the gate with merge changesets, uninteresting interim changes, etc.</p><p>In most cases, you're going to need to make these go away before you push your changes out.</p><p>The command to do this is hg recommit (much like wx redelget, etc.)</p><p>recommit will take your changes to date, and create a single changeset containing those changes.</p><p>You may specify a checkin comment on the command line (-m), a file containing your checkin comments (-l), or, if neither are specified, hg recommit will pop up your $EDITOR with a buffer containing all the checkin comments you have used thus far, for you to edit into a form suitable for integration.</p><p>The same comment format is used with Mercurial as with TeamWare: a bug ID or ARC case reference, followed by its synopsis.</p><pre>

You should already know if you will be exempt from one or more of these rules.</p><p>You must also run this separately within usr/closed.</p><p>If passed the Hg global option -q, pbchk and nits will be silent about passing checks, only providing output for checks that fail.</p><h3 id="HIntegratingyourchanges28putback2Cpush29"><span>Integrating your changes (putback, push)</span></h3><p>Your RTI is approved, your workspace passes pbchk, your testing is complete. Now all you have to do is integrate.</p><p>You must push changes first from usr/closed (if appropriate) and then from your main workspace when you integrate.

So you'll want to push both in quick succession.</p><p>XXX: Notes about gate hooks, etc, etc, etc.</p><h2 id="HRunningaprojectgate"><span>Running a project gate</span></h2><p>Most of how you choose to run your project gates is entirely your own decision, these are merely recommendations, though it is probably worth your time to read them anyway.</p><p>Of course, when your project integrates you will have to follow most of the steps outlined in the previous section too.</p><h3 id="HSyncingupwithyourparentgate"><span>Syncing up with your parent gate</span></h3><p>At intervals, you're going to want to sync your project gate with its parent (onnv-gate, for instance). You probably want to do this on a regular schedule and at suitable points, what this schedule or these points are is entirely up to you, though we would advice you not merge constantly, both for the sake of providing you a stable basis for work, and to avoid filling your project gate history with minor merges. Merging as builds close may work fine in many cases, others may have different preferences.</p><p>Syncing with the parent is different in the case of the project gate, as you wish to preserve history of the merge, among other things.</p><h4 id="HCloneafreshchildofyourprojectgate"><span>Clone a fresh child of your project gate</span></h4><p>You should never do real work directly within your project gate, do the work in a child and push the changes to your gate when you are finished, as normal.</p><h4 id="HPullfromyourprojectgate27sparentatthepointyouwishtosyncupwith"><span>Pull from your project gate's parent at the point you wish to sync up with</span></h4><pre>

If you recommit relative to your project gate, you will not only remove the merge changeset you created, but also the changesets from your project gate's parent since, relative to your project gate, those changes are local to your merge workspace.<br/>So when you do this, you're throwing out a lot of history from the parent of your project gate.<br/>This is not fatal, in that when you next sync up, you'll pull all that history again, then merge it again, but you're making work for yourself as well as throwing away information. Eventually, when you plan to integrate, you would have to pull all this history (throughout the life of your project), and recommit again against the gate to which you intend your project to integrate.<br/>Don't do it.</li></ul><p>You may notice that the above may take some time, during which others may be changing your project gate, and causing you to possibly have to merge with them.</p><p>In our experience this has been fairly rare, and how it should be dealt with is a project specific choice.</p><h3 id="HNeverrecommitwithinyourprojectgate"><span>Never recommit within your project gate</span></h3><p>You should never, ever, recommit the contents of your project within the project gate. This will considerably disrupt each and every person who has a child of your project gate (your co-workers), throw away valuable project history, and serve no practical purpose.</p><p>Don't do it, ever.</p><h3 id="HBackingoutundesirablechanges"><span>Backing out undesirable changes</span></h3><p>Mercurial's hg backout command is the best way to achieve this.</p><p>It will create an inverse changeset on top of the change to be backed out, which you may then need to merge if the changeset to be backed out is not the tip (using the -m flag to backout will start the merge for you).</p><p>This will want two commit messages, one for the backout changeset itself, and once for the merge (if necessary).</p><p>As with syncing up with your gate's parent, you should perform backouts in a child of your project gate, and then push them to the project gate itself.</p><p>If your backout required a merge, you should probably recommit it, as its function is plain enough, and the extra merge in the history is not useful to you.</p><p>If the change to be backed out contained changes to the closed portion of your project gate, you will need to perform a similar backout there, too. Never backout only one side of such a change.</p><pre>

You could merge out of schedule, which is probably better if what you want is large, or depends on other changes.</p><p>You can hg export that revision from the parent, and import that diff into a child of your project gate, test, and the push to your project gate.</p><p>The latter can be somewhat automated using Mercurial's transplant extension, which is not documented here.</p><p>If you choose to do a full merge, it should be performed as all other merges, and as documented above.</p><h3 id="HIntegration"><span>Integration</span></h3><p>Integrating your project is much like integrating any other change you have made, however there are a few other things which you should do.</p><p>Do the integration from a child of your project gate.</p><p>Take a fresh child of your project gate, run hg pbchk within that child.
