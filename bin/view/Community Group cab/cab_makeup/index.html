This is about<br/>&nbsp;ensuring that things like the long term stability of the ABI and legacy<br/>&nbsp;modules are not compromised. Imagine if a change to ld.so prevented loading<br/>&nbsp;of any executable pre opensolaris. For example I think we should take a long<br/>&nbsp;hard look at the ddi to make driver porting easier from other OSes, but this<br/>&nbsp;needs to be designed in a way that doesn't affect legacy driver<br/>&nbsp;compatibility. I think its abbsolutely essential to get this right first time<br/>&nbsp;since long-term ddi stability will pave the way to the creation of a large<br/>&nbsp;driver base due to minimal maintenance requirements and avoid Linux like<br/>&nbsp;version/distro dependence.<br/>&nbsp;3. Business acumen. I believe this needs to exist both in the community and<br/>&nbsp;the Sun CAB participants. The project needs to be business friendly and have<br/>&nbsp;some strategic direction as well as technical (tactical) direction. There's<br/>&nbsp;no point in inventing a better mousetrap if there are no mice to catch. It's<br/>&nbsp;quite hard though to maintain strategic direction in an open project since<br/>&nbsp;participants are free to ignore the strategy.

Publicity and Media savvy.&#160; OpenSolaris will hopefully attract quite a lot<br/>&nbsp;of media coverage and this needs to be managed deftly.<br/>&nbsp;5. Community Mindedness, OpenSolaris is intended to be a community so it's<br/>&nbsp;very important there is no bias or dogmatism at the CAB level. The CAB should<br/>&nbsp;be able to&#160; continually demonstrate respect for differing opinions. For<br/>&nbsp;example decisions should be based on fact rather than opinion where possible<br/>&nbsp;and the CAB should give reasons for (adverse) decisions rather than issue<br/>&nbsp;proclamations like some (better left unnamed) projects.<br/>&nbsp;Bob<br/>&nbsp;-<del>- Original Message -</del>-<br/>&nbsp;Subject: [Fwd: Re: [Opensolaris-discuss] CAB Makeup]<br/>&nbsp;Date: Fri, 28 Jan 2005 16:20:09 +0800<br/>&nbsp;From: Jeremy Teo &lt;Jeremy.Teo@sun.com&gt;<br/>&nbsp;Reply-To: Jeremy.Teo@sun.com<br/>&nbsp;To: opensolaris-discuss@opensolaris.org<br/>&nbsp;[Warning: First Post to this mailing list]<br/>&nbsp;Hi all,<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; We should all be considering the makeup of the CAB in terms of what's<br/>&nbsp;best for<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; the Project. I already broached the subject of&#160; internationalisation.<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Choosing a panel of only 5 people with the right attributes will be<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; exceedingly hard but here's what I see we need<br/>&nbsp;I think one thing we all don't want (to state the obvious) is to have so<br/>&nbsp;many people on the CAB such that we end up suffering from "design by<br/>&nbsp;committee".<br/>&nbsp;On the other hand, internationalization is an admirable ideal, and we<br/>&nbsp;should aim to have a CAB that represents the international community.<br/>&nbsp;I firmly believe that for a open source project to work, steady and<br/>&nbsp;robust work must be done. The XFree86 fiasco is a good example of how<br/>&nbsp;politics and design by committee has set back development by goodness<br/>&nbsp;knows how long.<br/>&nbsp;Of course forking is always a last resort, given the CDDL allows this.<br/>&nbsp;But at this stage, no one can't really fork Open Solaris until a<br/>&nbsp;solution to the eucumbered binaries issue is found (eventually).<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; 2. Configuration Management &amp; Compatibility, often this is seen as a<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; conservative opposing force to Innovation, but it need not be. This is<br/>&nbsp;about<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; ensuring that things like the long term stability of the ABI and legacy<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; modules are not compromised. Imagine if a change to ld.so prevented<br/>&nbsp;loading<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; of any executable pre opensolaris.

I think its abbsolutely essential to get this right<br/>&nbsp;first time<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; since long-term ddi stability will pave the way to the creation of a<br/>&nbsp;large<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; driver base due to minimal maintenance requirements and avoid Linux like<br/>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; version/distro dependence.<br/>&nbsp;Agreed on this. To state the obvious, we should start off on the right<br/>&nbsp;foot with a decent DDI/DKI interface, one that we can live with for very<br/>&nbsp;long, rather than having to rewrite it every other kernel release<br/>&nbsp;because our original design was flawed. (Reference to Linux). I'm don't<br/>&nbsp;know if we can do this, but it is definitely worth shooting for.<br/>&nbsp;Ultimately, technical merits and not politics/opinion should drive the<br/>&nbsp;decision of the CAB regarding all matters.<br/>&nbsp;I am unsure about how the CAB will make decisions regarding issues in<br/>&nbsp;future: Is that to be decided? Will it be something along the lines of</li><li>CAB proposes decisions, and outlines reasons behind it<br/>&nbsp;2. Community members vote on it.<br/>&nbsp;3. Decision is passed or failed.<br/>&nbsp;Perhaps I'm jumping the gun here, but just thinking out loud.<br/>&nbsp;Regards,<br/>&nbsp;Jeremy.<br/>&nbsp;-<del>- Original Message -</del>-<br/>&nbsp;Subject: Re: [Opensolaris-discuss] CAB Makeup<br/>&nbsp;Date: Fri, 28 Jan 2005 01:02:55 -0800<br/>&nbsp;From: Ben Rockwood &lt;benr@cuddletech.com&gt;<br/>&nbsp;To: bobl@optushome.com.au<br/>&nbsp;CC: opensolaris-discuss@opensolaris.org<br/>&nbsp;References: &lt;200501281745.57130.bobl@optushome.com.au&gt;<br/>&nbsp;I won't dwell, but just some quick thoughts.<br/>&nbsp;Robert Lunnon wrote:<br/>&nbsp;&gt;A lousy day at work has led me to think of this post ...<br/>&nbsp;&gt;<br/>&nbsp;&gt;We should all be considering the makeup of the CAB in terms of what's best for<br/>&nbsp;&gt;the Project.

Innovation, not only someone who likes to progress technical innovation but<br/>&nbsp;&gt;Innovation should extend to the way the whole opensolaris works and interacts<br/>&nbsp;&gt;with it's developer&#160; and customer marketplaces. Innovation should be prized<br/>&nbsp;&gt;as the rare commodity it is.<br/>&nbsp;&gt; &#160;<br/>&nbsp;&gt;<br/>&nbsp;Agreed.&#160; This is largely the purpose of the project and something that<br/>&nbsp;the CAB will undoubtably<br/>&nbsp;want to foster.&#160; I doubt anyone would argue there.&#160; However, innovation<br/>&nbsp;will come<br/>&nbsp;or not based on the community involvement, drive, and skill level; while<br/>&nbsp;the CAB can focus,<br/>&nbsp;invite it, and help nourish it, the CAB itself can only put in place and<br/>&nbsp;hopefully manage that<br/>&nbsp;enviroment.<br/>&nbsp;&gt;2. Configuration Management &amp; Compatibility, often this is seen as a<br/>&nbsp;&gt;conservative opposing force to Innovation, but it need not be. This is about<br/>&nbsp;&gt;ensuring that things like the long term stability of the ABI and legacy<br/>&nbsp;&gt;modules are not compromised.

Business acumen. I believe this needs to exist both in the community and<br/>&nbsp;&gt;the Sun CAB participants. The project needs to be business friendly and have<br/>&nbsp;&gt;some strategic direction as well as technical (tactical) direction.

The management skills do exist<br/>&nbsp;&gt;however,&#160; to bring&#160; a community along a strategically planned path without<br/>&nbsp;&gt;undue prescriptive measures.<br/>&nbsp;&gt; &#160;<br/>&nbsp;&gt;<br/>&nbsp;Business concousness is important, but I think having a CAB focused on<br/>&nbsp;whats right for the community<br/>&nbsp;and OpenSolaris as a whole, for it's own sake, is the driving factor. &#160;<br/>&nbsp;Making OpenSolaris&#160; a continueing<br/>&nbsp;better choice than the other variety of OS's out there, increasing<br/>&nbsp;capability, and putting in and managing<br/>&nbsp;a solid framework by which to foster these advances is what the CAB<br/>&nbsp;really needs to focus on.<br/>&nbsp;&gt;4. Publicity and Media savvy.&#160; OpenSolaris will hopefully attract quite a lot<br/>&nbsp;&gt;of media coverage and this needs to be managed deftly.<br/>&nbsp;&gt; &#160;<br/>&nbsp;&gt;<br/>&nbsp;I think this is the responsablity of all of the community.&#160; It has been<br/>&nbsp;for the last couple months, is today, and<br/>&nbsp;will be a major issue of importance moving forward.&#160; Obviously<br/>&nbsp;interviews with "John Doe, Member of the OpenSolaris CAB"<br/>&nbsp;will hold some weight and thus the CAB members need to be open as<br/>&nbsp;elevated representatives of the entire<br/>&nbsp;community, but then thats just part of the job.<br/>&nbsp;&gt;5. Community Mindedness, OpenSolaris is intended to be a community so it's<br/>&nbsp;&gt;very important there is no bias or dogmatism at the CAB level. The CAB should<br/>&nbsp;&gt;be able to&#160; continually demonstrate respect for differing opinions. For<br/>&nbsp;&gt;example decisions should be based on fact rather than opinion where possible<br/>&nbsp;&gt;and the CAB should give reasons for (adverse) decisions rather than issue<br/>&nbsp;&gt;proclamations like some (better left unnamed) projects.<br/>&nbsp;&gt; &#160;<br/>&nbsp;&gt;<br/>&nbsp;And here lies the beauty of the CAB.&#160; It'll be interesting to see just<br/>&nbsp;how much "power" the CAB<br/>&nbsp;will have, and how they choose to use it.&#160; Early on it will a learning<br/>&nbsp;experience for all concerned, I<br/>&nbsp;think we'd agree.&#160; But by nature the CAB can't dictate to the community,<br/>&nbsp;only serve it's best interests.<br/>&nbsp;A riot breaking out in the group won't be good for anyone, and even<br/>&nbsp;though forks are "possible" by<br/>&nbsp;terms of the license I don't think anyone wants to see break away<br/>&nbsp;developement for some time to come<br/>&nbsp;(minus embedded projects, PPC, etc, where it's appropriate).<br/>&nbsp;The responsiblity of those elected to the CAB will be heavy indeed.&#160; I'm<br/>&nbsp;tempted to ask if anyone really<br/>&nbsp;thinks their up to it for a whole year (your not gettin' paid remember),<br/>&nbsp;it's going to be alot of work and<br/>&nbsp;time and thought to do whats right; but then by definition these members<br/>&nbsp;will be doing what we all feel<br/>&nbsp;is the best direction, they simply need to choose of the opinions which<br/>&nbsp;is right.<br/>&nbsp;I really think Sun did a good job on finding a nice size for the CAB.&#160; 2<br/>&nbsp;in, 2 out is great... this 5th slot is<br/>&nbsp;giving me nightmares, but I trust the judgement of those that can decide<br/>&nbsp;this, they've exceeded our expectations<br/>&nbsp;largely thus far and I don't see them stopping one bit.&#160; There are<br/>&nbsp;obvious things to get worried about, like<br/>&nbsp;do we want 2 Sun employees that are in the same building on the CAB<br/>&nbsp;where they can discuss out of channels,<br/>&nbsp;or ensure that both community members aren't in the US, or making sure<br/>&nbsp;that.... or that.... or that....... on and on and on.<br/>&nbsp;I've stopped worrying about it and think the best thing we can do is<br/>&nbsp;simply ensure that the 2 people we can<br/>&nbsp;elect are the right people for the job, reguardless of any other<br/>&nbsp;concern.&#160; The first year is going to be cricital and<br/>&nbsp;there is no presidence by which to judge the future or work details of<br/>&nbsp;the job, and no one will know, but finding people<br/>&nbsp;who are skilled, talented, and experienced are good, and finding people<br/>&nbsp;that are passionate, dedicated, and<br/>&nbsp;excited are even better... the trick is to strike that balance between<br/>&nbsp;all the factors.<br/>&nbsp;Just a rememinder, those wishing to be nominated that haven't been heard<br/>&nbsp;much from yet should probly make<br/>&nbsp;themselves known and intentions clear so we can get all these<br/>&nbsp;discussions in as soon as possible.&#160; I've already<br/>&nbsp;made my recommendations but I know some folks may want the job and<br/>&nbsp;haven't spoken up yet.&#160; Don't<br/>&nbsp;neglect to step up and just go for it.&#160; Choice is a good thing. :)<br/>&nbsp;benr.<br/>&nbsp;&gt;Bob<br/>&nbsp;-<del>- Original Message -</del>-<br/>&nbsp;Subject: Re: [Opensolaris-discuss] CAB Makeup<br/>&nbsp;Date: Fri, 28 Jan 2005 22:13:19 +1100<br/>&nbsp;From: Shanon Loveridge &lt;sloveridge@gmail.com&gt;<br/>&nbsp;Reply-To: shanon@tinytech.net<br/>&nbsp;To: os-discuss &lt;opensolaris-discuss@opensolaris.org&gt;<br/>&nbsp;On Fri, 28 Jan 2005 01:02:55 -0800, Ben Rockwood &lt;benr@cuddletech.com&gt; wrote:<br/>&nbsp;&gt; Just a rememinder, those wishing to be nominated that haven't been heard<br/>&nbsp;&gt; much from yet should probly make<br/>&nbsp;&gt; themselves known and intentions clear so we can get all these<br/>&nbsp;&gt; discussions in as soon as possible.&#160; I've already<br/>&nbsp;&gt; made my recommendations but I know some folks may want the job and<br/>&nbsp;&gt; haven't spoken up yet.&#160; Don't<br/>&nbsp;&gt; neglect to step up and just go for it.&#160; Choice is a good thing. :)<br/>&nbsp;Speaking of which can someone post a list of the people that have been<br/>&nbsp;nominated? As I believe I saw a couple early on but can't find who.<br/>&nbsp;I would also like to nominate Ben Rockwood (If he has not already been<br/>&nbsp;nominated).

I am sure he would be the first to say<br/>&nbsp;he is not an expert system programmer but his passion and dedication<br/>&nbsp;would be an asset in attracting new people and inspiring them to<br/>&nbsp;contribute.
