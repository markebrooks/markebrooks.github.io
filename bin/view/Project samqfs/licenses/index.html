This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br/>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br/>under the terms of this General Public License. &nbsp;The "Program", below,<br/>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br/>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br/>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br/>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br/>language. &nbsp;(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br/>the term "modification".) &nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p><p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br/>covered by this License; they are outside its scope. &nbsp;The act of<br/>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br/>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br/>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br/>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p><ol><li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br/>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br/>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br/>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br/>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br/>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br/>along with the Program.</li></ol><p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br/>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br/>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br/>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br/>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parties under the terms of this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License. &nbsp;(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p><p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. &nbsp;If<br/>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br/>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br/>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br/>sections when you distribute them as separate works. &nbsp;But when you<br/>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br/>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br/>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br/>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p><p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br/>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br/>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br/>collective works based on the Program.</p><p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br/>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br/>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br/>the scope of this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br/>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br/>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customarily used for software interchange; or,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to distribute corresponding source code. &nbsp;(This alternative is<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received the program in object code or executable form with such<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p><p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br/>making modifications to it. &nbsp;For an executable work, complete source<br/>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br/>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br/>control compilation and installation of the executable. &nbsp;However, as a<br/>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br/>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br/>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br/>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br/>itself accompanies the executable.</p><p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br/>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br/>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br/>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br/>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br/>except as expressly provided under this License. &nbsp;Any attempt<br/>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br/>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br/>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br/>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br/>parties remain in full compliance.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br/>signed it. &nbsp;However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br/>distribute the Program or its derivative works. &nbsp;These actions are<br/>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. &nbsp;Therefore, by<br/>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br/>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br/>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br/>the Program or works based on it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br/>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br/>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br/>these terms and conditions. &nbsp;You may not impose any further<br/>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br/>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br/>this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br/>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br/>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br/>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>excuse you from the conditions of this License. &nbsp;If you cannot<br/>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br/>may not distribute the Program at all. &nbsp;For example, if a patent<br/>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br/>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br/>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br/>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p><p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br/>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br/>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br/>circumstances.</p><p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br/>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br/>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br/>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br/>implemented by public license practices. &nbsp;Many people have made<br/>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br/>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br/>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br/>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br/>impose that choice.</p><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br/>be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br/>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br/>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br/>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br/>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br/>countries not thus excluded. &nbsp;In such case, this License incorporates<br/>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br/>of the General Public License from time to time. &nbsp;Such new versions will<br/>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br/>address new problems or concerns.</p><p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. &nbsp;If the Program<br/>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br/>later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br/>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br/>Software Foundation. &nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of<br/>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br/>Foundation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br/>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br/>to ask for permission. &nbsp;For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br/>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br/>make exceptions for this. &nbsp;Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br/>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br/>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO WARRANTY</p><ol><li><ol><li>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br/>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN<br/>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br/>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br/>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br/>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. &nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br/>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. &nbsp;SHOULD THE<br/>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br/>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</li></ol></li></ol><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br/>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br/>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br/>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br/>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br/>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br/>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br/>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br/>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Apply These Terms to Your New

to most effectively<br/>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br/>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &nbsp;&lt;name of

the first released version of the Lesser GPL. &nbsp;It also counts<br/>&nbsp;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br/>&nbsp;the version number 2.1.]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br/>freedom to share and change it. &nbsp;By contrast, the GNU General Public<br/>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br/>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br/>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br/>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. &nbsp;You<br/>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br/>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br/>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br/>not price. &nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br/>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br/>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br/>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br/>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br/>these things.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br/>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br/>rights. &nbsp;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br/>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br/>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br/>you. &nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br/>code. &nbsp;If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br/>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br/>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br/>it. &nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br/>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br/>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br/>there is no warranty for the free library. &nbsp;Also, if the library is<br/>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br/>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br/>author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br/>introduced by others.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br/>any free program. &nbsp;We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br/>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br/>restrictive license from a patent holder. &nbsp;Therefore, we insist that<br/>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br/>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br/>ordinary GNU General Public License. &nbsp;This license, the GNU Lesser<br/>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br/>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. &nbsp;We use<br/>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br/>libraries into non-free programs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br/>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br/>combined work, a derivative of the original library. &nbsp;The ordinary<br/>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br/>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. &nbsp;The Lesser General<br/>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br/>the library.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br/>does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br/>Public License. &nbsp;It also provides other free software developers Less<br/>of an advantage over competing non-free programs. &nbsp;These disadvantages<br/>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br/>libraries. &nbsp;However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br/>special circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br/>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br/>a de-facto standard. &nbsp;To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br/>allowed to use the library. &nbsp;A more frequent case is that a free<br/>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. &nbsp;In this<br/>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br/>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br/>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br/>free software. &nbsp;For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br/>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br/>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br/>system.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br/>users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br/>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br/>that program using a modified version of the Library.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>modification follow. &nbsp;Pay close attention to the difference between a<br/>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". &nbsp;The<br/>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br/>be combined with the library in order to run.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br/>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br/>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br/>this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br/>Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br/>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br/>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br/>which has been distributed under these terms. &nbsp;A "work based on the<br/>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br/>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br/>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br/>straightforwardly into another language. &nbsp;(Hereinafter, translation is<br/>included without limitation in the term "modification".)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br/>making modifications to it. &nbsp;For a library, complete source code means<br/>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br/>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br/>and installation of the library.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br/>covered by this License; they are outside its scope. &nbsp;The act of<br/>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br/>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br/>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br/>writing it). &nbsp;Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br/>and what the program that uses the Library does.</p><ol><li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br/>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br/>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br/>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br/>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br/>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br/>Library.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br/>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br/>fee.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br/>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br/>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br/>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the event an application does not supply such function or<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its purpose remains meaningful.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application. &nbsp;Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;root function must still compute square roots.)</p><p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. &nbsp;If<br/>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br/>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br/>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br/>sections when you distribute them as separate works. &nbsp;But when you<br/>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br/>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br/>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br/>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br/>it.</p><p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br/>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br/>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br/>collective works based on the Library.</p><p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br/>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br/>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br/>the scope of this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br/>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. &nbsp;To do<br/>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br/>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br/>instead of to this License. &nbsp;(If a newer version than version 2 of the<br/>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br/>that version instead if you wish.) &nbsp;Do not make any other change in<br/>these notices.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br/>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br/>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br/>the Library into a program that is not a library.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br/>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br/>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br/>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br/>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br/>medium customarily used for software interchange.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br/>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br/>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br/>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br/>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br/>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br/>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". &nbsp;Such a<br/>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br/>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br/>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br/>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br/>library". &nbsp;The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br/>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br/>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br/>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br/>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br/>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. &nbsp;The<br/>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br/>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br/>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br/>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br/>work. &nbsp;(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br/>Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br/>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br/>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br/>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br/>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br/>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br/>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br/>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br/>engineering for debugging such modifications.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br/>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br/>this License. &nbsp;You must supply a copy of this License. &nbsp;If the work<br/>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br/>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br/>directing the user to the copy of this License. &nbsp;Also, you must do one<br/>of these things:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;executable containing the modified Library. &nbsp;(It is understood<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to use the modified definitions.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library. &nbsp;A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least three years, to give the same user the materials<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the cost of performing this distribution.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specified materials from the same place.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br/>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br/>reproducing the executable from it. &nbsp;However, as a special exception,<br/>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br/>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br/>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br/>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br/>the executable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br/>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br/>accompany the operating system. &nbsp;Such a contradiction means you cannot<br/>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br/>distribute.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br/>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br/>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br/>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br/>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br/>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facilities. &nbsp;This must be distributed under the terms of the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections above.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br/>the Library except as expressly provided under this License. &nbsp;Any<br/>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br/>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br/>rights under this License. &nbsp;However, parties who have received copies,<br/>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br/>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br/>signed it. &nbsp;However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br/>distribute the Library or its derivative works. &nbsp;These actions are<br/>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. &nbsp;Therefore, by<br/>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br/>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br/>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br/>the Library or works based on it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br/>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br/>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br/>subject to these terms and conditions. &nbsp;You may not impose any further<br/>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br/>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br/>this License.</p><ol><li><ol><li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br/>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br/>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br/>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>excuse you from the conditions of this License. &nbsp;If you cannot<br/>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br/>may not distribute the Library at all. &nbsp;For example, if a patent<br/>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br/>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br/>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br/>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</li></ol></li></ol><p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br/>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br/>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p><p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br/>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br/>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br/>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br/>implemented by public license practices. &nbsp;Many people have made<br/>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br/>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br/>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br/>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br/>impose that choice.</p><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br/>be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br/>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br/>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br/>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br/>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br/>excluded. &nbsp;In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br/>written in the body of this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br/>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br/>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br/>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p><p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. &nbsp;If the Library<br/>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br/>"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br/>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br/>the Free Software Foundation. &nbsp;If the Library does not specify a<br/>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br/>the Free Software Foundation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br/>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br/>write to the author to ask for permission. &nbsp;For software which is<br/>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br/>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &nbsp;Our<br/>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br/>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br/>and reuse of software generally.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO WARRANTY</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br/>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br/>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br/>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br/>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br/>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>PURPOSE. &nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br/>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. &nbsp;SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br/>THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br/>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br/>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br/>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br/>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br/>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br/>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br/>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br/>SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br/>DAMAGES.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br/>everyone can redistribute and change. &nbsp;You can do so by permitting<br/>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br/>ordinary General Public License).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. &nbsp;It is<br/>safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br/>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br/>"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &nbsp;&lt;name of author&gt;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. &nbsp;See the GNU<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesser General Public License for more details.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA &nbsp;02110-1301 &nbsp;USA</p><p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p><p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br/>school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br/>necessary. &nbsp;Here is a sample; alter the names:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ty Coon, President of Vice</p><p>That's all there is to it!</p><p><tt class="wikimodel-verbatim">================================================================================</tt><br/>The BSD License</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a BSD license template.

Each Contributor<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before distributing the Program.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;license set forth in this Agreement.</p><p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p><p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under<br/>its own license agreement, provided that:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) its license agreement:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&nbsp;</p><p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.&nbsp;</p><p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the<br/>Program.</p><p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if<br/>any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the<br/>originator of the Contribution.</p><p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p><p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with<br/>respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is<br/>intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who<br/>includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner<br/>which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if<br/>a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such<br/>Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify<br/>every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages<br/>and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal<br/>actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the<br/>extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in<br/>connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product<br/>offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses<br/>relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order<br/>to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial<br/>Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor<br/>to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and<br/>any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may<br/>participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p><p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product<br/>offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that<br/>Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties<br/>related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such<br/>Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the<br/>Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other<br/>Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court<br/>requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial<br/>Contributor must pay those damages.</p><p>5. NO WARRANTY</p><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN<br/>"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR<br/>IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,<br/>NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each<br/>Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using<br/>and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise<br/>of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and<br/>costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of<br/>data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p><p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY<br/>CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,<br/>SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST<br/>PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,<br/>STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY<br/>WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS<br/>GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>7. GENERAL</p><p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable<br/>law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the<br/>terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such<br/>provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such<br/>provision valid and enforceable.</p><p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to<br/>a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a<br/>lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such<br/>Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation<br/>is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any<br/>entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the<br/>Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or<br/>hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights<br/>granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is<br/>filed.</p><p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to<br/>comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does<br/>not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of<br/>such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,<br/>Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as<br/>reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement<br/>and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue<br/>and survive.</p><p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in<br/>order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be<br/>modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to<br/>publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.<br/>No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.<br/>IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to<br/>serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version<br/>of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program<br/>(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of<br/>the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of<br/>the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program<br/>(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated<br/>in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to<br/>the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether<br/>expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not<br/>expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p><p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the<br/>intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this<br/>Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year<br/>after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial<br/>in any resulting litigation.</p><p><tt class="wikimodel-verbatim">================================================================================</tt><br/>The MIT License</p><p>Copyright (c) &lt;year&gt; &lt;copyright holders&gt;</p><p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br/>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal<br/>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br/>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br/>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br/>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p><p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br/>all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p><p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br/>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br/>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replaced with your own identifying information.
