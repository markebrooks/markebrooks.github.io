The applications are protected from each other to provide software fault isolation. To ease the labor of managing multiple applications and their environments, they co-exist within one operating system instance, and are usually managed as one entity.</p><p>The original operating environment, before any zones are created, is also called the "global zone" to distinguish it from non-global zones, The global zone is the operating system instance.</p><h4 id="HQ:Whatisacontainer3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> What is a container?</em></span></h4><p><strong>A:</strong> A native, default zone on the Oracle Solaris 10 OS is called a container. The other containers that run on Oracle Solaris 10 include Oracle Solaris 8 Containers and Oracle Solaris 9 Containers. Many people use the terms "zone" and "container" interchangeably.</p><h4 id="HQ:Whattypesofzonesareavailable3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> What types of zones are available?</em></span></h4><p><strong>A:</strong> It is possible to create non-global zones that run the same OS as the global zone, which is the OS running on the system. It is also possible to create a non-global zone that runs a different operating environment from the global zone. The branded zone (BrandZ) framework extends the zones infrastructure to include the creation of brands that contain alternative sets of runtime behaviors. The following types of non-global zones are available:</p><ul><li><strong>native</strong>:<br/>A default Oracle Solaris Container non-global zone is called a native zone. It has the same characteristics as the Oracle Solaris 10 Operating System release that is running in the global zone.<br/>If you have configured your system with Oracle Solaris Trusted Extensions, each non-global zone is associated with a level of security, or label. Labeled zones can be configured starting with the Oracle Solaris 10 11/06 release. For more information, see <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-0867/">&nbsp;Solaris Trusted Extensions Installation and Configuration</a></span>.</li><li><strong>ipkg</strong>: <br/>The ipkg non-global zone is the default non-global zone on the OpenSolaris release. It has the same characteristics as the release that is running in the global zone. Each ipkg zone manages its own software packages.</li><li><strong>Branded zones that run an environment different that the OS release on the system</strong> &nbsp;<ul><li>The lx branded zone introduced in the Solaris 10 8/07 release provides a Linux environment for your applications and runs on x86 and x64 machines on the Oracle Solaris 10 OS. For more information, visit the <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+brandz/">&nbsp;OpenSolaris Community: BrandZ</a></span>.</li><li>The solaris8 and solaris9 branded zones enable you to migrate an Oracle Solaris 8 or Oracle Solaris 9 system to an Oracle Solaris 8 or Oracle Solaris 9 Container on a host running the Oracle Solaris 10 8/07 Operating System or later Oracle Solaris 10 release. A solaris8 branded zone is an environment for Oracle Solaris 8 applications on SPARC machines. A solaris9 branded zone is an environment for Oracle Solaris 9 applications on SPARC machines. Now named Oracle Solaris 8 Containers and Oracle Solaris 9 Containers, these products were introduced through a product called the Solaris 8 Migration Assistant 1.0, on October 22, 2007.

Local zone?</em></span></h4><p><strong>A:</strong> After installing Oracle Solaris 10 on a system, but before creating any zones, all processes run in the global zone. After you create a zone, it has processes that are associated with that zone and no other zone. Any process created by a process in a non-global zone is also associated with that non-global zone.</p><p>Any zone which is not the global zone is called a non-global zone. Most people call non-global zones simply "zones." Some people call them "local zones" but this is discouraged.</p><p>The default native zone file system model on Oracle Solaris 10 is called "sparse-root." This model emphasizes efficiency and security at the cost of some configuration flexibility. Sparse-root zones optimize physical memory and disk space usage by sharing some directories, like /usr and /lib. Sparse-root zones have their own private file areas for directories like /etc and /var. Whole-root zones increase configuration flexibility but increase resource usage. They do not use shared file systems for /usr, /lib, and a few others.<br/>There is no supported way to convert an existing sparse-root zone to a whole-root zone. Creating a new zone is required. [August 2010]</p><h4 id="HQ:CanIcreateazonewhichshares2822inherits2229some2Cbutnotallof2Fusr2C2Flib2C2Fplatform2C2Fsbin3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> Can I create a zone which shares ("inherits") some, but not all of /usr, /lib, /platform, /sbin?</em></span></h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The original design of Solaris Containers assumes that those four directories are either all shared ("inherited") or all not shared. Sharing some and not others will lead to undefined and/or unpredictable behavior. [August 2010]</p><h4 id="HQ:HowdoIgetzonesorcontainers3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> How do I get zones or containers?</em></span></h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Oracle Solaris 10 includes all of the programs and files needed to use zones (and Containers). Operating systems based on the OpenSolaris code base, including OpenSolaris 2009.06, may elect to include support for zones. [August 2010]</p><h4 id="HQ:Whathardwarecanutilizezonesorcontainers3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> What hardware can utilize zones or containers?</em></span></h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Zones and resource management are all software features of Oracle Solaris and other operating systems based on the OpenSolaris code base. As software features, they do not depend upon any specific hardware platform. Any hardware that runs a Solaris distro (Oracle Solaris 10, OpenSolaris, or another) will be able to have these features.</p><h4 id="HQ:Willmysoftwareruninazoneorcontainer3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> Will my software run in a zone or container?</em></span></h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Most Oracle Solaris software will run unmodified in a zone, without needing to re-compile. Unprivileged software (programs that do not run as root nor with specific non-default privileges) typically run unmodified in a zone once they can be successfully installed. Installation software must not assume that it can write into shared, read-only file systems, e.g. /usr. This can be circumvented by adding a writable file system to the zone (e.g. at /usr/local) or using a whole-root zone.<br/>However, there are a few applications which need non-default privileges to run - privileges not normally available in a zone, such as the ability to set the system?s time-of-day clock. For these situations, the feature named "configurable privileges" has been added. This feature allows the global zone administrator - the person who manages zones on a system - to assign additional, non-default privileges to a zone. The zone?s administrator can then allow individual users to use those non-default privileges.<br/>An application that requires privileges that cannot be added to a zone might need modification to run properly in a zone.<br/>Here are some guidelines:</p><ul><li>An application that accesses the network and files, and performs no other I/O, should work correctly.</li><li>Applications that require direct access to certain devices, e.g., a disk partition, will usually work if the zone is configured correctly. However, in some cases this may increase security risks.</li><li>Applications which require <strong>direct</strong> access to these devices must run in the global zone, or must be modified to work correctly:<ul><li>/dev/kmem</li><li>a network device<ol><li>Starting with OpenSolaris build 37 and Oracle Solaris 10 8/07, a default zone can be configured as an "exclusive-IP zone" which gives it exclusive access to the NIC(s) that the zone has been assigned. Applications in such a zone can communicate directly with the NIC(s) available to the zone.</li><li>Applications running in shared-IP zones should instead use one of the many IP services.</li></ol></li></ul></li></ul><p>For more details, read the white paper "<span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/application_in_zone.html">Bringing Your Application Into the Zone</a></span>".

Additional packages installed in the global zone will require additional space in the non-global zones. ZFS quotas or SVM soft partitions can be used to enforce per-zone disk space constraints. When performing capacity planning, 100MB of additional RAM per zone is suggested (in addition to the needs of its workload). An application does not use any "extra" RAM because it is running in a zone.<br/>&nbsp;A zone installed using the "full-root model" will take up as much space as the initial Oracle Solaris 10 installation, which will be more than 500MB in most cases.

This includes the number and processing power of CPUs, memory size, NICs, HBAs, etc.</li><li>What portion of the installed zones are actually in use. For example, you can create 100 zones, each ready to offer a web service, but only boot the 10 that you need this month.

There are many situations where this will be the best approach to solve a problem. There are even situations which require such use.</p><p>&nbsp;First, however, it is important to stress that there are usually other solutions that do not require direct device access. Let’s discuss this first.</p><p>&nbsp;With regard to importing VxVM devices into a zone: this is possible with VxVM 5.0MP3 and up. For earlier versions, your options depend on the goal. If the goal is to make a file system available in the zone, the solution is to create the file system in the global zone, and LOFS or direct mount the file system in the zone. On the other hand, if the goal is to make a mirrored block device available in the zone, the only solution is to upgrade to VxVM 5.0MP3 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;If you want to make a file system available in the zone, create the file system in the global zone, and use LOFS to make the file system available in the zone. On the other hand, if the goal is to make a mirrored block device available in the zone, another solution must be found.</p><p>&nbsp;In any situation, if direct device access is required within a zone, you must perform careful failure analysis and evaluation of the possible outcomes of "catastrophic application failure. If the non-global zone will use COTS software, and will be managed by trustworthy people, then the risks will be small. Fortunately, in most cases there are also other solutions which do not use direct device access from a zone.</p><p>&nbsp;Here are two extreme examples:</p><ol><li>A zone will be created for the purpose of training students on basic Unix commands. The root account will only be used by the global zone administrator. The system will be attached to a LAN which is not connected to any other networks. The instructor needs access to the sound device. There are very few risks associated with such access - it would be very difficult for the sound device to suffer a failure, and even if it did it would be unlikely to affect other zones.<br/>&nbsp;The zone can be given access to this via the zonecfg sub-commands:</li></ol><pre>
global# zonecfg -z zonename
zonecfg:zonename&gt; add device
zonecfg:zonename:device&gt; set match=/dev/sound/*
zonecfg:zonename:device&gt; end
zonecfg:zonename&gt; exit
</pre><p>&nbsp;The zone will have access to sound devices, but will not have access to any other devices.<br/>2. A zone will be created for the purpose of teaching students about a database program that requires access to raw disk partitions. The instructor knows how to use Unix, but does not have a background in Unix system administration. Further, the instructor will require use of the root account to assist students. It is possible that the instructor could make a mistake, or a malicious student could abuse the raw disk access, leading to a crash of the kernel. This would also stop all of the other non-global zones, as well as the global zone. If the other zones are running production software, this request for raw disk access in a zone should not be fulfilled. Other solutions should be pursued, such as creating an RBAC role for the instructor which only gives the necessary privileges to the isntructor’s Unix account.</p><p>&nbsp;Other examples must be judged by their particulars, e.g. a production database program which needs raw access. Factors to consider include:</p><ul><li>Who will login to the zone? How trustworthy are they?</li><li>Is this system protected from unauthorized access by a firewall?</li><li>What level of availability is required by applications running in this zone and in other zones?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;For more information on this topic, see the section "SECURITY AND DATA INTEGRITY" of the man page for sgen(7d).<br/>[August 2010]</p><h4 id="HQ:CanIshareanI2FOresource28e.g.NIC2CHBA29betweencontainers3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> Can I share an I/O resource (e.g. NIC, HBA) between containers?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: Yes, in fact, that is the default model. Each container is assigned its own IP address, but usually multiple containers will share one NIC. Further, multiple zones may be assigned separate file systems accessed through one HBA. [August 2010]</p><h4 id="HQ:Canzonesinonecomputercommunicateviathenetwork3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> Can zones in one computer communicate via the network?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: Both shared-IP and exclusive-IP zones can communicate via the network. In general, a zone is assigned to use one or more network ports (aka NICs), and network traffic to or from other computers uses the assigned NIC(s), following standard IP rules.<br/>&nbsp;Network traffic between two zones on the same system may require extra planning. If a zone is an "exclusive-IP" zone, its network packets will always leave the computer, and inbound packets will always come from outside the computer. Further, an exclusive-IP zone performs all of its own network configuration, including routing and IP filtering.<br/>&nbsp;Before Solaris 10 10/08, network traffic between two <em>shared-IP</em> zones always stayed in the computer, i.e. it didn’t traverse the physical network. This provided very high bandwidth, low latency transmission. However, starting with Solaris 10 10/08, traffic between two shared-IP zones stays in the computer <em>unless</em> a default router is used for one or both zones. Traffic from a zone with a default router will go out to the router before coming back to the destination zone. For more information on default routers for zones, see the <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-1592/z.conf.start-85?l=en&amp;a=view&amp;q=default+router">documentation</a></span> and <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/stw/entry/using_zonecfg_defrouter_with_shared">Steffen’s blog</a></span>.<br/>&nbsp;Full IP-level functionality is available in an exclusive-IP zone.

A zone does not need a network interface in order to operate. If you don’t specify a network interface when you create the zone, it will still boot correctly. If an existing zone has been given access to a network interface, you can use zonecfg(1M) to remove that access, but if the zone is running you must also either re-boot the zone or use ifconfig(1M) to remove access until the next re-boot.<br/>&nbsp;It is also possible to allow a shared-IP zone to access the network, but not communicate with other zones on the same system. One method is to set up a pair of routes using the "-reject" argument to the route(1) command.

This requires using some combination of the Fair Share Scheduler, CPU caps, assigned (’dedicated’) CPUs, and/or [Dynamic] Resource Pools features.</p><p><strong>Fair Share Scheduler:</strong> FSS guarantees a <em>minimum</em> amount of CPU utilization, so it doesn’t waste CPU cycles. Excessive CPU use is only prevented if there is contention for CPU resources. Minima are specified by "shares" and enforced by the Fair Share Scheduler. You can assign 100 shares to each of two workloads, 200 shares to a third workload, and 400 shares to the global zone. The first two workloads will get at least 1/8 of the CPUs' capacity, if they need it, and the global zone will get at least 1/2 of the CPUs' capacity, if it needs it. If only one Container wants to use the CPUs, it will be able to use all of the processing capacity of the system. <br/>You should give the global zone a quantity of shares similar to the largest quantity given to any Container, to ensure that you can manage the Containers.</p><p>Starting with Solaris 10 5/08, you can use the <strong>capped-cpu</strong> resource type. Starting with Solaris 10 8/07, you can use the <strong>dedicated-cpu</strong> resource type to automatically create a temporary pool when the zone boots.

Then create a zone and bind it to the same resource pool. Run the application in that zone. The application will only "see" that set of processors.

You <em>can</em> globally limit the size of the swap-based file systems (e.g. /tmp) by using the "size" mount option in the container’s /etc/vfstab file, e.g. "size=200m".

It is possible to install a zone into a ZFS fs, but the installer/upgrader program does not yet understand ZFS well enough to upgrade zones that ’live’ on a ZFS file system. Because of this, upgrading a system that has a zone installed on a ZFS file system is not yet supported.<br/>2. If all non-global zones that are configured with "lofs" fs resources are mounting directories that exist in the miniroot, the system can be upgraded from a previous release of Solaris 10 to the Solaris 10 11/06 release using standard upgrade. For example, a lofs mounted /opt directory presents no issues for upgrade.<br/>&nbsp;However, if any of your non-global zones are configured with a non-standard lofs mount, such as a lofs mounted /usr/local directory, the following error message is displayed:</li></ol><pre>

</pre><p>The error message is incorrect: although this error message states that the system must be restored from backup, the system is actually fine, and it can be upgraded successfully using the workaround.</p><pre>
Workaround:
1. Reboot your system with the installed OS.
2. Reconfigure the zones, removing the "fs" resources defined with a
type of "lofs."
3. After removing these resources, upgrade the system to Solaris 10 11/06.
4. Following the upgrade, you can again reconfigure your zones to
restore the additional "fs" resources that you removed.

It is critical to avoid zone state transitions during lucreate and lumount operations.</p><ul><li>When you lucreate an alternate boot environment (ABE), if a zone is not running, then it cannot be booted until the lucreate has completed.</li><li>When you lucreate an ABE, if a zone is running, it should not be halted or rebooted until the lucreate has completed.</li><li>When an ABE is lumounted, you cannot boot zones or reboot them, although zones that were running before the lumount can continue to run.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Because a non-global zone can be controlled by a non-global zone administrator as well as the global zone administrator, it is best to have all zones halted during lucreate or lumount.</p><p>&nbsp;It is important to note that when LU operations are underway, non-global zone administrator involvement is critical. The upgrade affects their work as administrators, and they will be dealing with the changes that occur as a result of the upgrade. They should make sure that any local packages are stable throughout the sequence, handle any post-upgrade tasks (such as configuration file tweaking), and generally schedule around the system outage.</p><p>&nbsp;Here is an example of a problem that could occur if these guidelines are not followed.

It is normal and expected that a migrated zone and a newly installed zone would have different patches. The update on attach feature looks at the zone you are migrating and determines which packages need to be updated to match the new host. Only those packages are updated. By definition, the rest of the packages (with their patches) are allowed to vary from zone to zone. You can think of this as setting up a number of zones and then, over time, the zone administrators for those zones install and remove packages and apply different patch streams to the packages that they are allowed to change in their zones.<br/>&nbsp;The update on attach feature for zone migration was added in the Solaris 10 10/08 release.<br/>&nbsp;[August 2010]</p><h4 id="HQ:Itriedtohaltmyzonebutitisstuckinthe27shuttingdown27or27down27stateandwon27thalt.WhatshouldIdo3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> I tried to halt my zone but it is stuck in the 'shutting down' or 'down' state and won't halt.

By default it is very difficult for one local zone to affect another zone, but it is possible. It is also easy for the global zone administer to configure containers unsafely. Consider these factors:</p><ul><li>First, there are no known methods for one user (even root) in one zone to ’break into’ another zone (global or non-global).<br/>&nbsp;However, a modern computer has many resources, some of them real, some virtual. Denial of Service attacks often attempt to use all of the instances of a virtual resource. One early attack on Unix systems was creating so many processes that all of the PIDs were in use, preventing the creation of new processes. There are now methods to prevent those attacks, and those methods automatically apply, or have been applied to, zones. In some cases the method of prevention includes the manual use of Solaris features, e.g. projects.</li><li>By default it is difficult to disrupt operation of zones. However, the global zone administrator can make it easier for a non-global zone user to impact operation of one or more other zones, even the global zone. Try to avoid assigning disk devices directly to non-global zones: the root user of that zone might be able to take advantage of this to cause a SCSI bus reset or even panic the kernel. Also, avoid assigning the same device or file system to multiple zones unless needed to achieve a specific goal. If that is necessary, ensure that all of the software in those two zones will obey a synchronization mechanism when using the device or file system.</li></ul><h4 id="HQ:HowdoIpreventa2019forkbomb2019fromaffectingallofthezones3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> How do I prevent a ’fork bomb’ from affecting all of the zones?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: A ’fork bomb’ is a process which creates (forks) as many child processes as possible, attempting to use up all of the virtual memory or PIDs in a system, resulting in a Denial of Service to other users.

Because the Solaris privilege ’proc_lock_memory’ is in a zone’s default set of privileges, you should limit the amount of RAM that a particular zone can lock.

You can use detach and attach -u as a workaround. Detach the zone before running pkg_image-update, and use attach -u after running pkg_image-update. [Added June 2009]</p><h4 id="HQ:WhyarezonessodifferentonOpenSolaris3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> Why are zones so different on OpenSolaris?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: IPS is a new model for software management, and zones have to change to utilize this model.[Added June 2009]</p><h4 id="HQ:Whycan2019tIusesparserootzones3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> Why can’t I use sparse root zones?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: The sparse root type of zone describes a fundamental interaction between zones and the package management system, and IPS doesn’t support this concept. BUT, we’re working on providing the positive attributes of sparse root zones in different ways:</p><ul><li>reduced memory footprint</li><li>reduced disk footprint</li><li>centralized control of zone’s software</li><li>security due to read-only mounts</li><li>faster install/upgrade times</li><li>fewer bits to migrate across systems</li></ul><p>&nbsp;[Added June 2009]</p><h4 id="HQ:ArezonesonOpenSolarisdone3FWillzonescontinuetolookliketheydoon2009.063F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> Are zones on OpenSolaris done? Will zones continue to look like they do on 2009.06?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: No, zones are a work in progress and things will continue to evolve as development continues. [Added June 2009]</p><h4 id="HQ:HowdoIcontrolwhatsoftwareisinstalledinthezone3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> How do I control what software is installed in the zone?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: Use the -e option to zoneadm install. [Added June 2009]</p><h4 id="HQ:Whyiszonerootitsowndataset3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> Why is zone root its own dataset?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: Eventually, we want to support beadm inside zones for pkg_image-update, just as you can do in the global zone. To accomplish this, the zone’s root dataset must be controlled inside the zone. [Added June 2009]</p><h4 id="HQ:Whyisn2019tthezonerootavailablewhenthezoneishalted3FHowdoIsetupthezone2019ssysidcfgfile3F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> Why isn’t the zone root available when the zone is halted? How do I set up the zone’s sysidcfg file?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: Ready the zone, which will mount the correct zone root dataset.

Where did it go?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: OpenSolaris zones are a little different from Solaris 10 zones. When a zone is in the 'installed' state, its ZFS file system is not mounted. To mount the zone's root file system before booting the zone, use this command:&nbsp;</p><pre>

global# zoneadm -z &lt;zonename&gt; ready

</pre><p>Then edit &lt;zonepath&gt;/root/etc/sysidcfg. After that, you can finish booting the zone. If the sysidcfg file was correct, configuration questions will not be sent to the zone's console, and it will complete the boot process.</p><h4 id="HQ:CanIcontinuetousezonescreatedonOpenSolaris2008.053F"><span><em><strong>Q:</strong> Can I continue to use zones created on OpenSolaris 2008.05?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: No, existing zones from this release cannot be used.

What should I do?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: The most common problem is that the zone doesn’t have its system identification information yet. You can determine if this is the problem by running "ps -fz " in the global zone. If the output only shows zsched, init, and a (3-6) processes related to SMF (/lib/svc/..., /usr/sbin/svccfg) then system identification is not complete. To complete this, attach to the zone’s console by running "zlogin -C " in the global zone, pressing &nbsp;once, and following the instructions.

What should I do?</em></span></h4><p>&nbsp;A: This resulted from a bug that was fixed in Solaris Express 4/06. It will be corrected in Solaris 10 11/06 as well.<br/>&nbsp;Updated information on privileges and zones has been added to the System Administration Guide: Solaris Containers--Resource Management and Solaris Zones. See <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-2450/z.admin.ov-1">documentation</a></span> for a list of the Solaris privileges and the status of each privilege with respect to zones. To alter privileges in zones, use the limitpriv property in zonecfg.
