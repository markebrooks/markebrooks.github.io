1: ==Project Status Page==
2: 
3: In lieu of a blog we will go a simple route here just posting notes with their associated dates. Jump to the bottom of the page to see the latest boot log output from the target.
4: 
5: We have completed process of pushing out code to the ppc-dev svn repository and the internal Sunlabs repository is now deprecated even though it still functional. While we could drop tarballs it doesn&#8217;t seem to provide much value but can if requested.
6: 
7: ==Current tasks in process==
8: 
9: 1. Establish outward facing PPC development server vespa2 - done
10: 1. Establish svn access with both pp-dev and labs polaris-trunk from vespa2 - done
11: 1. Build vespa2:$HOME/usr/src/uts - done
12: 1. Build vespa2:/$HOME/usr/src/lib - done - TODO: add rules for automated genassym and assym.h building.
13: 1. Verify ODW boot and statically linked userland shell - the last development point when the Labs exited the project. - done
14: 1. Rebuild all tools onbld, gcc, cmd/sgs and verify functionality based on all ppc-dev bits - in process
15: 1. Update website and associated documentation - ongoing basis
16: 1. Move druidia and 2nd ODW target to external site - pending
17: 1. Fix lost MAC address bug to allow other 2 ODW targets to boot on VOF - pending
18: 1. Sync the ppc-dev source to the latest Open&#60;nop&#62;Solaris repository - pending
19: 1. Move the current repo control from subversion to Mercurial - pending
20: 
21: ===Vespa2 as a development system is fully functional===
22: 
23: We have succeeded in recreating and then moving one of the Sun&#60;nop&#62;Labs development systems to be publicly available. A serious developer can now log into vespa2.sunlabs.com, pull the ppc-dev source, build it, download their kernel, boot it and debug it on a target Pegasos ODW system there. The statically linked init is a demonstration of a userland program that forks and execs, executes in from user space and returns to the kernel.    
24: 
25: ===Vespa2 is now externally accessible===
26: 
27: It is the first of two standalone development servers have been turned outward facing and is externally accessible by the community. These systems were the original project hardware used by the Pulsar Project and have been generously donated by SunLabs. They will be maintained at the Sun Menlo Park Bldg 16 facility but are not part of the Sun network or any project. This has not been a simple task and some details remain. Pictures are always good so here is the stuff in action. vespa2 shown on the bottom with an ODW board above. There is a network controlled powerstrip that can be used to recycle power and provide reset to the ODW target system. 
28: 
29: [[[image:labdev4small.jpg||alt=&#34;vespa2 server and ODW target&#34;]]](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/ppc-dev/status/labdev4_small.jpg &#34;The externally available ppc-dev system&#34;)
30: 
31: ===Now Have 2 Development Systems and 3 Targets ~-- 02/04/2009===
32: 
33: We now have 2 available solaris build and boot servers for our odw targets. They are vespa and vespa2. Additionally we have drudia, a linux server which functions as a boot server for the third odw target. Anyone wanting to use druidia would build their bins on either vespa or vespa2 then scp over to druduia and execute on the odw served from drudia. We will be placing them on the external network shortly and they will be generally available for anyone who would like to do development. 
34: 
35: ===Development Systems Up ~-- 01/25/2009===
36: 
37: We have emerged from a self imposed hibernation. It seems that the folks really interested in getting a PPC port have returned and are now putting in the effort to make further progress.
38: 
39: Sunlabs has agreed to host the previous development systems and offer remote access. There will be two individual servers each with a ODW target and power / reset control. One setup will have a BDI debugger.
40: 
41: The svn repo has been updated with the final work done by Guy Shaw, this wraps up any direct work by SunLabs. There is a single user prompt in a statically linked init.
42: 
43: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 02/18/2008===
44: 
45: Now at rev 111. Major items to note
46: 
47: Bug fixes for missing BRL instruction in a number of critical assembly files
48: Implement lwp_pcb_exit()
49: 
50: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 11/02/2007===
51: 
52: Now at rev 97. Major items to note
53: 
54: We have sync&#8217;d with onnv bld 58 ~----hmmm aren&#8217;t we a bit behind
55: 
56: Well this is the bulk of the commit, we have not done a merge since earlier this year. Why? It&#8217;s a messy thing being on a parallel path here, but this will take us from 57 to 58. We will now be spending time on playing catchup to get back in sync with the releases. Guy does this by himself. There is alot more work to do now with each one of these since we are successfully building much more of the consolidation. The lack of accounting for a 3rd architecture can be painfully seen with each one of these but we grind away.
57: 
58: Updates to sgs. We can now build rtld (ld.so.1)
59: 
60: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 10/29/2007===
61: 
62: It is now at rev 95. Many updates to lib/ and a number of shared objects are building. We have yet to actually test any of this on the target since we need a functional rtld, which should be here soon.
63: 
64: You will need to build the libs with make -k install. We have a problem with building lint related items and that will get you temporarily past the issue.
65: 
66: To build you will also need the updated toolchain which has a reconfigured gcc which now handles c++. 
67: 
68: Once you have the right shared objects you should also be able to build cmd/init and cmd/sh. 
69: 
70: ===Sync Up with Sun Labs Source Development Complete ~-- 10/11/2007===
71: 
72: Ok, we&#8217;re now at rev 93 and the repo is in sync with the Sun Labs development. All of the latest code is out. It should build cleanly, just follow the instructions. If you have any questions, feedback, suggestions or want to jump in post to the discussion list. 
73: 
74: We&#8217;re in the process of updating the task pages and overall documentation on the project itself. Please take the time to review and provide feedback or information updating.
75: 
76: ===Successful Bulding of SVN repository ~-- 10/09/2007===
77: 
78: The ppc-dev repo is now at rev 89 this is around the mid Aug 07 development timeline so we&#8217;re now only a few months behind. Lots of ddi and interrupt development was going on. The additional good news here is that the repo is building on the outside by community members. 
79: 
80: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 09/28/2007===
81: 
82: It is now at rev 82 this is now around the June 07 development timeline so the ppc-dev code base is catching up. This putback has updates to the VM, HAT layer and PMDB. A few more drivers completes the PPC driver build dirs and their associated Makefiles.  
83: 
84: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 09/27/2007===
85: 
86: It is now at rev 80. This putback generally completes adding the PPC driver build dirs and their associated Makefiles. It also has the start of the CBE work along with update pci nexus and genral interrupt work. There are updates to the tool set that Guy has created, see the work in onbld. Added a bit of support for the EFIKA platform, but ODW continues to be the platform we develop on. 
87: 
88: You may notice in the log alot of comments to code regarding double mappings. This was a problem we fought with for a while before finding an oversight related to the ODW firmware and active BAT regs that we thought were disabled. 
89: 
90: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 09/25/2007===
91: 
92: It is now at rev 79. This putback includes a large number of the PPC driver build dirs and Makefiles. It also has the start of the rootnexus and ddi interface.
93: 
94: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 09/20/2007===
95: 
96: It is now at rev 78. At this point the interrupt framework and the cbe was just being added. The PMDB (Poor Mans Debugger) was updated and also some VM related work was added. The RHINE ethernet chip driver was added here.
97: 
98: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 09/11/2007===
99: 
100: It is now at rev 72. This is about half way through the merge of the ppc-dev tree with bld 57. Best to wait till the whole merge is pushed out before attempting to build and test. Note you will need to load ands run VOF on top of the ODW&#8217;s firmware. A binary has been provided. 
101: 
102: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 08/28/2007===
103: 
104: It is now at rev 62. This includes the beginning merge of the ppc-dev tree with bld 56 which is around the Jan 07 timeframe. Notable commits are related to mdb and other kernel boot funcs.
105: 
106: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 07/23/2007===
107: 
108: It is now at rev 38. This is up to the merge of the tree with bld 54. You will have to use the updated toolchain GNU/GCC/AS/solaris ld from now on to build. Get it [[here&#62;&#62;Project ppc-dev.tools]]
109: 
110: ===Updated SVN repository ~-- 06/22/2007===
111: 
112: It is now at rev 24. These updates were still related to general work that continued in the kernel bringup but you may also notice the cmd/sgs ld work that&#8217;s was going on. 
113: 
114: ===More SVN Updates ~-- 06/20/2007===
115: 
116: Gotta love svn. The merge command works well on files that are already in place. but won&#8217;t create new files. We&#8217;ve been using svn cat to create the new files, do an svn add, then go for the merge.
117: 
118: ===Created SVN repository ~-- 06/10/2007===
119: 
120: Populated it with the source from the initial code release. As usual doing something for the 1st time always takes a bit longer to get the hang of it. The SCM management support wasn&#8217;t available back at the time of the 1st source drop so the tarball was essentially it. You can access according to the [[std instructions&#62;&#62;Community Group tools.svn_help]]. For example you would have svn+ssh://user@svn.opensolaris.org/svn/ppc-dev/ppc-dev. You also need to be affiliated with the project and have a public key available on your profile. 
121: 
122: ===Updated GNU Assembler ~-- 11/27/2006===
123: 
124: The GNU ld was covering up the incorrect symbol relocations, fancy that. The new one is here /opt/polaris/powerpc-solaris2/bin/as. The difference is that the new as should generate the proper relocations for unaligned 32 and 16 bit address relocations. With this new as we can go back to compiling with -g -gdwarf-2. 
125: 
126: ===Merger with build 54 complete ~-- 11/22/2006===
127: 
128: onnv-gate build 54 (2006-Nov-22) and the ppc-dev source base is complete. This is not a simple job, many files must be hand merged after the bulk is integrated. 
129: 
130: ===Active topics ~-- 11/20/2006===
131:     1. Figured out problems with inetboot. Restricted reads to 1K as the     ethernet driver in the OF drops back to back packets.  Also randomized the initial port number so that back to back reboots won&#8217;t have to wait for 4 minutes for the previous connections to time out.
132:     1. Cross built ld.  Required libconv, libelf, libld, liblddbg as well. Most of usr/src/cmd/sgs builds, but not all.  Skipped over TLS (thread local storage) stuff for now.  Also did nothing for 64-bit.  Main issues surrounded no cross building was envisioned or testing.  Byte flipping issues abound.
133:     1. kernel and boot both can be properly built by the Solaris ld. We&#8217;ve switched over to the Solaris ld totally now and using the Solaris kernel mapping layout.  Still cannot run at 0xe0000000 as OF has problems dealing with non real mode addresses.
134:     1. Got krtld working.  Apparently fully functional.  Issues w/byte flipping in doreloc() and addend values were both in the addend field of the relocation and left at the memory location referred to by the relocation.
135:     1. Worked on and analyzed issues with usr/src/tools/ctf
136:     1. Started working on mdb/kmdb.  Makefile tree in place.
137:     1. Created a work around solution for genassym/assym.h until the ctf tools are functional.  Compile the offsets (data table only) with the GNU gcc cross compiler into an assembler file.  Use that assembler file as input into Sun x86 c compiler.  Relies on the fact that the x86 and PowerPC assemblers are very similar.
138: 
139: ===Move to solaris ld ~-- 11/09/2006===
140: 
141: It is available in /opt/onbld/usr/ccs/bin/ld. There are also the libraries which are in /opt/onbld/lib/.  In order to run the new linker you must set in your environment LD=/opt/onbld/usr/ccs/bin/ld then export LD.
142: 
143: But now we run into some very strange issues with symbol unaligned relocations. Since we use the Metrowerks PowerTAP and Codewarrior for source level debuging we need to have DWARF symbols even though we can build successfully without them. The solaris ld complains, but the GNU ld never did.
144: 
145: (for sh and bsh at least). 
146: 
147: ===KRTLD update ~-- 11/07/2006===
148: 
149: krtld is running. 
150: inetboot loads /platform/chrp/kernel/unix.
151: inetboot reads unix and observes that misc/krtld
152: is required.  inetboot reads in /kernel/misc/krtld.
153: Control is transferred to krtld.  krtld relocates
154: itself and then reads unix for its symbols and
155: well as reading that genunix is needed.  krtld
156: then reads in genunix and relocates it and
157: binds everything together.  Control is then
158: transferred to unix which starts execution. 
159: 
160: ===Initial project contribution ~-- 10/02/2006===
161: 
162: This was quite a bit of work just to get to this point but now there is a working development system available to all who would like to particpate in any area of this project. There is no closed code, all of the platform source is open. The build is sync with ON a bit past BLD_47. The Polaris task map was updated also.
163: 
164: In simple terms the kernel boots and outputs to the console to a point and then will panic. This is currently during the VM initialization.  Development continues not only on the VM/HAT but in parallel on KRTLD, RTLD. At this time however we statically link unix/genunix to facilitate debugging. The [[task map&#62;&#62;Project ppc-dev.task_map]]  is the best way to obtain details on development status of each area.

In this run we have replaced the &#34;usual&#34; init with a application that is statically linked that simply does an open of the console device, a write of
192: &#34;Hello, world!&#34; and then exits.
