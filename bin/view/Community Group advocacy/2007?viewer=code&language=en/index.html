  6: 
  7: === Overview
  8: 
  9: The OpenSolaris Community started 2007 with a bang as the community broke new records for conversations even before engaging in a massive thread about future licensing options. Additionally, new components on the project were opened, and the community continued to meet within user groups and at conferences, and two new conferences have been set for February in Germany and India.

 11: === Quote of the Month
 12: 
 13: We want to make it easier for developers to not only work on OpenSolaris but to also develop applications on top of OpenSolaris. Getting more people to participate and making it easier for developers to start developing on Sun Solaris is the key thing we're focusing on. Stephen Harpster, Director of Open Source Engineering at Sun Microsystems, [[quoted in internet.com&gt;&gt;http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3653196]], 1/10/07.

 87: === Overview
 88: 
 89: In February, the OpenSolaris Community was busy participating at user groups and conferences around the world, opening projects and portals, contributing code, and finalizing plans for the first OpenSolaris election to select a new governing board and ratify the community governance. Also, right at the end of the month, Sun launched a new program to distribute OpenSolaris Starter Kits to community members around the world.

 91: === Quote of the Month
 92: 
 93: &quot;Kirk Skaugen, vice president and general manager of Intel's server products, said the 'open-sourcing of Solaris' changed Intel's mind about the OS ... [h]e noted that Intel has always been a strong proponent of open source, and applauded recent moves by Sun to make Solaris and Java open source. 'This is a new environment where there [is] a very large Solaris installed base that's moving toward open source.'&quot; - [[1/23/07, ZDNet Asia, Intel: Open source drew us to Solaris &gt;&gt;http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/software/0,39044164,61983979,00.htm]]

163: === Quote of the Month
164: 
165:  &quot;For the target market, we believe Sun has done a fine job of making itself pertinent again to a market segment that a few scant years past would have likely dismissed the notion of Solaris and Sun altogether.&quot; - [[New OpenSolaris distribution for developers, The Register, 3/9/07&gt;&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/09/sun_microsystems_opensolaris/]].

171: * The OpenSolaris Community went to [[the polls&gt;&gt;http://poll.opensolaris.org/2/]] in March and [[elected a new OpenSolaris Governing Board&gt;&gt;Community Group cab.OGB_Election_Status]].
