Apologies for the delay. The OpenSolaris community is growing rapidly in multiple directions, and we'd like the newsletter to cover as much of the community as possible. A Sun team produces the newsletter, but we'd like input from anyone interested in participating. So please feel free to respond to program-team at opensolaris.org and offer your news items or suggest any issues you'd like us to cover. Also, any feedback on the format or content would be most appreciated.</p><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Although December was filled with holidays and vacations, it was still a time of growth for the OpenSolaris community. We continue to see new user groups opening up and meeting around the world, OpenSolaris community members are presenting at conferences around the world, and new communities are opening on opensolaris.org. Although BrandZ was the only community to open on the site this month, several more communities and projects have been proposed, are forming, and will appear in January.</p><h3 id="HTechnicalStatus"><span>Technical Status</span></h3><p><strong>Engineering</strong></p><ul><li>Requirements for choosing a Source Code Management solution for OpenSolaris were posted.

Nothing beats a face to face meeting to go along with talking on lists and blogs. OpenSolaris community members are clearly increasing their involvement at conferences, and they are continuing to form user groups. It's not uncommon for a new user group to garner 50 people for a first meeting. As user groups grow, the topics of discussion are starting to diversify, and more people are starting to participate in new ways. Community members are taking photos and shooting videos and posting their presentations to share their experiences, and you can see everything here: <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+advocacy/os%2Dpresentations"><span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/advocacy/os-presentations/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://opensolaris.org/os/community/advocacy/os-presentations/</span></a></span></a></span></p><p>Here are the highlights for December</p><p><strong>User Groups</strong></p><ul><li>The SVOSUG had it's first annual Holiday open-potluck on Tuesday December 20.
