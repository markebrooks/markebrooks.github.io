RPE is part of the Solaris engineering organisation, within Sun's Software business unit. The RPE team are primarily focused on the ongoing sustaining engineering of the shipping releases of Solaris, although a good portion of the time is also spent working on the next release of Solaris. The tight integration and co-operation with the New Product Engineering (NPE) team is one of the key success factors of Solaris. Chris also spends a lot of time driving the high quality and feature rich message of Solaris 10 out to the field, its all about "Delivering on the Promise of Solaris 10" as his boss would say. Chris coined the phrase "Solaris 10, the highest quality operating system we have ever released" something that has absolutely seen being born out in deployment. Chris joined Sun in 1999 and has over 16 years of experience in the industry including software engineering of operating systems and application software for military usage. He has a BSc (HONS) degree in Computing Science from Staffordshire University. When he is not working he is married with two children, a dog, a cat and rabbit and enjoys Amateur Dramatics in what little spare time he has left.</p><p><strong>Chris Beal</strong>: Chris Beal is a Senior Staff Engineer working with Solaris Revenue Product Engineering. This team fixes the bugs found by customers. As a kernel engineer is the team chris has resolved many critical customer issues in areas as diverse as filesystems, predicitive self healing, scheduling and virtualization. As the lead engineer in the team Chris encourages the team to work the new and exciting technologies in OpenSolaris. Chris is curentley working on implementing solaris 10 on the Xen Hypervisor platform.</p><p><strong>Russ Blaine</strong>: Russell Blaine has been a developer in the Solaris Kernel group at Sun for six years. His areas of expertise include virtualization technologies, Solaris on x86 and AMD64, CPU performance counters, system call interfaces, and interrupt management. He most recently completed work on the BrandZ project, bringing linux emulation to Solaris Zones. He came to Sun in 2000 after receiving a BSE in Computer Science from Princeton University. and Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL). Before he joined Sun, Erik worked at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science.  He holds degrees from Linkoping University, Stanford University, and Uppsala University.</p><p><strong>Bev Crair</strong>: As Senior Director of the Solaris NAS team, Bev Crair leads the Solaris organization's file system and file sharing development team, responsible for ZFS, NFS, CIFS, and other NAS technologies. Prior to this, Bev served as Director of the Solaris Organization in various roles, including at Sun's China Engineering and Research Institute in Beijing, China for 18 months. She was a recipient of Sun's SMI Leadership Award in 2005. Bev has been with Sun since 1999. She holds a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of California at Santa Cruz, and an MBA from the Graziadio School of Management at Pepperdine University.</p><p><strong>Scott Dickson</strong>: Scott Dickson is an twelve-year Sun veteran and a twenty-plus-year Sun user. Working directly with customers in the field, Scott has focused on developing Solaris-based solutions for large and small enterprise customers, primarily in the communications and transportation industries. Currently, Scott is part of a team whose mission is to help customers move to Solaris 10 and to put in place methodologies to more easily move forward as new releases of Solaris are available. Prior to coming to Sun, Scott spent nearly ten years as a system administrator and applications programmer in a variety of Unix and mainframe systems. Scott received both his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science from Penn State University.</p><p><strong>Nicolas Droux</strong>: Nicolas Droux is a Senior Staff Engineer with the Solaris Core Technologies group at Sun Microsystems. He is currently working on the challenges surrounding networking performance and virtualization. In the recent past he was leading the effort that delivered Project Nemo a new high-performance device driver framework in Solaris. Nicolas was also a part of the Solaris security engineering team where he worked on the Solaris Cryptographic framework and rearchitected the Solaris IPsec implementation for improved performance and scalability. Nicolas received his B.S. degree in Computer Science from the Biel School of Engineering, Switzerland, in 1992.</p><p><strong>Glen Faden</strong>: Glenn Faden is a Senior Software Engineer in the Solaris Security Technologies Group, and has worked at Sun for 17 years. He is currently the architect for Solaris Trusted Extensions, and was one of the architects for Trusted Solaris and Role-Based Access Control.
