Ahrens</strong>: Matt Ahrens co-founded the ZFS project in 2001, and is now the ZFS engineering team lead. He has a degree in computer science from Brown University.</p><p><strong>Chris Armes</strong>: Chris is the Director of Solaris Revenue Products Engineering (RPE) for EMEA, based out of the UK. RPE is part of the Solaris engineering organisation, within Sun's Software business unit. The RPE team are primarily focused on the ongoing sustaining engineering of the shipping releases of Solaris, although a good portion of the time is also spent working on the next release of Solaris. The tight integration and co-operation with the New Product Engineering (NPE) team is one of the key success factors of Solaris. The team is very much a true example of global engineering being split equally across the three geographic regions that SMI operates in - AMER, EMEA and APAC. Chris himself has members of his team in each one of those three geographies. This he is sure is one of the factors that leads his wife to believe that the UK is just another hotel he stays in for a time during the year. The RPE team provide 24 x 7 source code engineering level expertise on the Solaris operating system. If you have an issue that needs code level expertise, including source code changes, delivered at 2am Pacific time on Christmas Day its likely you'll be working with someone in the Solaris RPE team. The team also owns a large number of the areas within Solaris that Sun is no longer doing active development on, such as UFS and SVM. This combines with working closely with our NPE colleagues on the latest and greatest parts of Solaris like ZFS and FMA makes the RPE organisation a particularly challenging and exciting team to be part of. Chris joined Sun in 1999 and has over 16 years of experience in the industry including software engineering of operating systems and application software for military usage. He has a BSc (HONS) degree in Computing Science from Staffordshire University. When he is not working he is married with two children, a dog, a cat and rabbit and enjoys Amateur Dramatics in what little spare time he has left.</p><p><strong>Madhan Balasubramanian</strong>: Madhan Balasubramanian has worked in Services, Solaris Cluster Manager and Data Service Configuration Wizards since joining Sun in 2005. His areas of interest are High Availability &amp; System Management tools. Madhan regularly participates in product design discussions and reviews and helps partners port their Applications to Solaris Cluster. Prior to joining Sun, he worked for Oracle Corp. on Networking and Enterprise Manager products.</p><p><strong>Chris Beal</strong>: Chris Beal is a Senior Staff Engineer working with Solaris Revenue Product Engineering. This team fixes the bugs found by customers. As a kernel engineer is the team chris has resolved many critical customer issues in areas as diverse as filesystems, predicitive self healing, scheduling and virtualization. As the lead engineer in the team Chris encourages the team to work the new and exciting technologies in OpenSolaris. Chris is curentley working on implementing solaris 10 on the Xen Hypervisor platform.</p><p><strong>Russ Blaine</strong>: Russell Blaine has been a developer in the Solaris Kernel group at Sun for six years. His areas of expertise include virtualization technologies, Solaris on x86 and AMD64, CPU performance counters, system call interfaces, and interrupt management. He most recently completed work on the BrandZ project, bringing linux emulation to Solaris Zones. He came to Sun in 2000 after receiving a BSE in Computer Science from Princeton University. and Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL). Before he joined Sun, Erik worked at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science.  He holds degrees from Linkoping University, Stanford University, and Uppsala University.</p><p><strong>David Bustos</strong>: David Bustos is a senior engineer in the Solaris SMF team. He has worked in the Solaris Core OS group for five years. After helping implement SMF in Solaris 10, he is now working on the next major improvement to SMF as the leader of the Enhanced SMF Profiles project.</p><p><strong>Aaron Dailey</strong>: Professionally, I've been an engineer nearly twenty years. I graduated from University of Virginia computer science department. While I can't claim to have worked on a punch card machine, they did wheel out the last punch card machine out of the computer center my first year at UVA. Since then, I've worked in several different companies, mostly storage and/or Unix related, from IBM to Adaptec, to a startup called Chaparral (now part of Dot Hill), and now Sun. All were good in their own ways, although I do particularly enjoy Sun. In early 2006 I had an opportunity to come to China to do some training for several months. I jumped at the idea, and liked it enough that I decided to stay. I spend time outside of work studying an MBA at Peking University. I feel very fortunate to have met my wife here, a wonderful Chinese woman.</p><p><strong>Roger Dong</strong>: Roger Dong Yudong is a Senior Manager for Solaris Storage group in China Our group is responsible for both SCSI and Fiber Channel framework in Solaris. Currently, we are working in 4K block size support and Fiber Channel port visualization projects. We also have some engineers doing research on Tape self identification and Fiber Channel Over Ethernet projects. Beside these two teams, we are also responsible for the release engineering work in Solaris storage gate.</p><p><strong>Glen Faden</strong>: Glenn Faden is a Distinguish Engineer in the Solaris Security Technologies Group, and has worked at Sun for 19 years. He is currently the architect for Solaris Trusted Extensions, and was one of the architects for Trusted Solaris and Role-Based Access Control. He designed Sun's multilevel desktops based on Open Look and CDE, and is currently an advisor to the team developing Trusted JDS. Glenn has made extensive contributions to the Solaris security foundation, including Access Control Lists, Auditing, Device Allocation, and OS Virtualization. He also developed the RBAC and Process Rights Management tools for the Solaris Management Console. He has authored several articles for Sun's Blueprints website, and the Solaris Developer Connection.Glenn previously worked for Qubix, OmniCad, and Gould Computer Systems in Desktop Publishing and OS development. He has an MS in Computer Science from Florida Institue of Technology.</p><p><strong>Valerie Fenwick</strong>: Valerie Anne Fenwick is a Staff Engineer at Sun Microsystems with over a decade of experience in computer security. Valerie is currently working on making the Solaris Cryptographic Framework, of which she was a designer and major contributor, FIPS 140 compliant. She is a sponsor for the OpenSolaris project and was a leader in redefining the software bugtracking strategy and processes used across Sun today. Previously Valerie was the technical lead for the release of Solaris 10 1/06 and was responsible for NAT implementation as well as other network security features of the SunScreen firewall. Valerie has an B.S. in Computer Science from Purdue University. In her spare time, she enjoys performing at community theaters, riding her bike, and skiing.</p><p><strong>Jim Grisanzio</strong>: Jim Grisanzio is a Sr. Program Manager on the OpenSolaris Project. He is based out of the Sun's Tokyo office and works for the company's OpenSolaris kernel engineering organization in California. He has managed multiple engineering and community-development efforts at Sun, and he has a background in technical communications and project management.

He received a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics from Technische Hochschule Darmstadt in 1991. His scientific work was focussed on design and implemetation of high speed data acqusition and analysis systems for nuclear physics experiments. He is currently Staff Engnineer at Sun Microsystems Germany, located in Frankfurt/Main. At Sun his early activity was Solaris Kernel sustaining engineering with focus on filesystems and volume management. Later, he changed to UFS engineering and studied resilience aspects of filesystems. Next, he started sustaining engineering for SunCluster 3.x with special focus on PxFS and cluster transport. Guenter is currently introducing the sustaining engineering model for Sun Grid Engine.</p><p><strong>Wyllys Ingersoll</strong>: Wyllys is a Senior Staff Engineer in the Solaris Security organization.
