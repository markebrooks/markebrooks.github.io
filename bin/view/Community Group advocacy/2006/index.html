<h1 id="HNewsletterArchive:2006"><span>Newsletter Archive: 2006</span></h1><hr/><h1 id="HOpenSolarisNewsletter:January2006"><span>OpenSolaris Newsletter: January 2006</span></h1><h3 id="HOverview"><span>Overview</span></h3><p>January 2006 marks about six months since the OpenSolaris project opened. The community continues to grow, which is demonstrated by a wide variety of metrics. More communities and projects are opening on the site, which is generating significant levels of conversation across the mail lists; the OpenSolaris Charter conversation has largely come to fruition and Constitution conversations have begun; new code has been released with still more on the way; contributions continue to be offered and integrated; and sections of the website have been updated to make it easier to participate.</p><p>January was also a time when this newsletter entered its second month of open operations, and we are starting to see some interest from community members who want to participate. The newsletter will live within the Content Project for now, and we hope that writers from the community will start to draft some news pieces we can highlight. The newsletter is still going out late, and for that we apologize. We are improving, however, and with next month's issue we'll be on time. Starting with the February issue, each newsletter will be published on the first day of the following month. So, the February issue will go out on March 1.</p><h3 id="HCommunityStatus"><span>Community Status</span></h3><p><strong>Community Advisory Board</strong></p><p>In late January, the <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+cab/">OpenSolaris Community Advisory Board (CAB)</a></span> and Solaris engineering came to agreement about the OpenSolaris Charter - which basically outlines the terms of reference for the OpenSolaris Governing Board (OGB) and the OpenSolaris community. Additionally, the CAB has created a governance working group, invited community members Keith Wesolowski and Ben Rockwood to participate, and initiated conversations to complete the OpenSolaris Constitution. Just as the Charter was developed in the open on the <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=17">CAB's list</a></span> with community feedback, the Constitution will also be developed, debated, and ratified in the open.</p><p><strong>User Groups</strong></p><p>If you are interested in forming a user group or participating in a group in your area, check in on the <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+advocacy/usergroups">OpenSolaris User Group Community</a></span>. There are 26 groups now. Here are some highlights from January:</p><ul><li>The Atlanta OpenSolaris User Group met on January 10th. Topics of discussion included what's new in OpenSolaris, building &amp; accessing OpenSolaris source, and lightening talks.</li><li>Warangal OpenSolaris User Group met on January 12th. Topics of discussion included smart card source integration into OpenSolaris and issues around the NIT Warangal India students starting an OpenSolaris user group.</li><li>The Front Range OpenSolaris User Group met on January 19th to discuss ZFS and hear from Mark Maybee, a Solaris engineer who has spent the last five years working on ZFS.</li><li>The Sydney OpenSolaris User Group met on January 25th with talks from <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jmcp">James McPherson</a></span> on getting to know the SAN stack, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://bdgregg.blogspot.com/">Brendan Gregg</a></span> on Zone resource controls, and <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tpenta?entry=non_debug_open_solaris_my">Alan Hargreaves</a></span> on non-debug OpenSolaris.</li><li>The Silicon Valley OpenSolaris User Group met on January 26th with <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jimgris?entry=svosug_meeting_photos">Max Bruning</a></span> as the main speaker talking about OpenSolaris drivers.</li><li>New OpenSolaris User Groups created recently include Germany, Turkey, and French.</li></ul><p><strong>Projects &amp; Communities</strong></p><p>New communities and projects are forming consistently on OpenSolaris. Here is a summary for January:</p><ul><li>The <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+sysadmin/">OpenSolaris Systems Administrators Community</a></span> opened on January 11th for systems administrators, engineers, and architects to collaborate and enhance the manageability of OpenSolaris.</li><li>The<span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+ethbridge/">Ethernet bridge</a></span> project opened on January 10th to maintain a software Ethernet bridge module for Solaris.</li><li>The <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+arc/">OpenSolaris ARC Community</a></span> opened on January 13th and is responsible for driving the development, deployment, and use of transparent processes that guide the evolution of the OpenSolaris architecture, both at the macro (systems) and micro (project) levels.</li><li>The <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+appliances/">Appliances Community</a></span> also opened in January to sift the enormous configuration permutations of hardware, application software and OpenSolaris itself and to provide low cost, feature rich appliances for all (especially for the home and the small office).</li><li>The <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+storage/">OpenSolaris Storage Community</a></span> opened on January 27th and is dedicated to the storage software in OpenSolaris.</li><li>The <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+content/">OpenSolaris Content Project</a></span> opened on January 30th. This project will provide a forum for community members interested in writing, editing, and reviewing a variety of OpenSolaris content.</li><li>In late January, the PowerPC community <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://polaris.blastwave.org/">launched a new community site called Polaris</a></span>, which is a project name for the OpenSolaris port to the PowerPC architecture. The site is based on Trac open source software and has resources like wiki, ticket tracking, and project management.</li></ul><p><strong>Contributions</strong></p><ul><li>The request-sponsor program continues to be successful. Four putbacks were integrated in January. At the end of the month we had a total of 34 contributions putback, two were awaiting sponsors, and 18 had sponsors and were in progress.

February was a short month but a busy one nonetheless.</p><p>This newsletter attempts to offer a snapshot of the OpenSolaris Program and what's going on within the community. Because the project is large and diverse, we realize we can't capture everything in every issue. We are considering adding some new categories to the newsletter - such as a "Community &amp; Project Highlights" section, where one group would have some space to talk about any important development; an "Anecdote of the Month" section, where a community member could tell a brief personal story about some issue or experience; and a "Conferences" section, where community members can talk about their travels to various events around the world.

Two days later, Sun Microsystems also approved the Charter, and the document was signed by Glenn Weinberg, vice president of Sun's Operating Platforms Group. The <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+cab/charter">OpenSolaris Charter</a></span> enfranchises the "OpenSolaris Governing Board (OGB) to manage and direct an OpenSolaris community in its efforts to improve upon and advocate in favor of OpenSolaris, so that the community may long endure." The current CAB members now comprise the initial OGB, and their first order of business is to create the OpenSolaris Constitution. These <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://www.genunix.org/wiki/index.php/OpenSolaris_Governance">governance conversations</a></span> have already begun, and the documents will be written, debated, iterated, and ratified in the open - just as the Charter was developed in the open. OpenSolaris community members are encouraged to comment on any governance-related matter on <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=17">the OGB's list</a></span>.<br/><strong><br/>&nbsp;Projects &amp; Communities</strong></p><p>OpenSolaris currently has <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Main/communities">38 communities</a></span> and <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Main/projects">7 projects</a></span>, with new communities and projects being discussed and proposed regularly on the mail lists. During the first few months of OpenSolaris, mostly communities formed. Now that the site has support for projects, however, most of the activity is around the formation of development projects. This trend is expected to continue. In February, one new community and five new projects were opened:</p><ul><li><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+network%2Dsip/">Session Initiation Protocol Project</a></span> opened 2/3.</li><li><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+vpanels/">Visual Panels Project</a></span> opened 2/6.</li><li><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+games/">OpenSolaris Games Community</a></span> opened 2/7.</li><li><span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=103">ksh93 Integration Project (list only)</a></span> opened 2/13.</li><li><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+nwam/">Network Auto-Magic Project</a></span> opened on 2/17.</li><li><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+zfs%2Dcrypto/">ZFS on Disk Encryption Support Project</a></span> opened 2/22.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Projects approved for future opening include: Key Management Framework, Resource Management, Solaris on zSeries Mainframe Servers, and /usr/ sfw Nevada. Communities approved for future opening include: Packaging, Installation, and Distribution. Several additional communities have been proposed but are not yet approved.</p><p><strong>Contributions</strong></p><p>Our goal is to highlight a variety of contributions that community members are offering. Here are some contributions this month:</p><ul><li>Three ON code contributions (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=6271&amp;tstart=0">here</a></span>, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=6295&amp;tstart=0">here</a></span>, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=6314&amp;tstart=0">here</a></span>) were integrated in February. Note that <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=6314&amp;tstart=0">the most recent one</a></span> was code for an RFE that required ARC approval. This is our first ARC approval for an external contribution - congratulations to Rich Lowe for the contribution and to Dan Price for his sponsorship.</li><li>At the end of the month, a total of 37 contributions had been integrated, three were awaiting sponsors, and 24 had sponsors and were in progress. A total of 89 request-sponsor contributions have been offered since launch. Full details on these code contributions are in the <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Main/request_sponsor">request-sponsor</a></span> report.</li><li>Two other ARC cases are in progress related to external code contributions: one about pools submitted by Robert Milkowski and one about a tty lock program submitted by Rich Teer. Both are being sponsored by Darren Moffat. A table will be created next month to track ARC cases like the request-sponsor report tracks code contributions. Also next month, the materials associated with these cases will be published in the ARC community.</li><li>An article about getting started with OpenSolaris using VMWare was contributed to the <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+content/">Content Project</a></span> by Bill Rushmore. It can be viewed on the articles page. Ignacio Marambio Catán is in the process of translating several articles into Spanish and plans to make those documents available to the community. Several additional content contributions have been proposed as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Conversations</strong></p><ul><li>In February, conversations on the <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/jive/index.jspa">96 Jive discussion forums</a></span> topped the 2.3 million views mark since the project opened. The forums have also garnered just under a million unique visitors since launch.</li><li>In an effort to help community members keep up with who's talking about what across a wide variety of OpenSolaris communities and projects, Eric Boutilier has created a series of mail-list "roll up reports," which are like meta-digests. The reports were prompted by the expansion of new communities and projects on opensolaris.org (each of which have their own mail list forum) and the growth of forum traffic in general. The typical way to follow a forum is to periodically scan the header of every new post. The digests make this more efficient by providing a periodic (e.g. bi-weekly), condensed snapshot highlighting three things: (1) original posts made by lead members, (2) the size of each thread (topic popularity), and (3) who was posting and how much, and of those, which ones are community/project leaders. The digests are being posted on the opensolaris-discuss forum and <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://del.icio.us/bootblog/oss:rollups">on the web at del.icio.us</a></span>.

However, Sun sent several executives, and OpenSolaris was discussed in multiple conversations. Jonathan Schwartz delivered the opening keynote, and Tim Bray and Bill Vass participated on several panels. Jim Grisanzio attended the conference and <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimgris/sets/72057594065194745/">posted some photos</a></span>.<br/>&nbsp;FOSDEM, February 25th and 26th: FOSDEM, on the other hand, is a free software developer gathering, and OpenSolaris did have a presence.

SIGCSE is the Special Interest Group for Computer Science Education, the eponymous event is its annual conference. In 2006 it took place in Houston, Texas, March 1st-5th. Around 1,200 computer science professors and professional educators from around the world (but mostly the US and especially the southern states) were present. OpenSolaris was represented by Russ Blaine, Patrick Finch, Teresa Giacomini, Eric Lowe and Michelle Olson from Sun and Sean Smith, assistant professor of computer science at Dartmouth College. Eric posted his talk and demo on his <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/elowe?entry=observing_the_solaris_kernel">blog</a></span>.

JavaUK06 took place on March 15th in London and was aimed at developers. Although billed primarily as a Java event, there was a strong Solaris presence as well. Alan Burlison from Sun manned an OpenSolaris stand and had a continual flow of people wanting to talk about OpenSolaris. Alan was asked how to get a copy to install and also fielded development questions about how the community works and how people can contribute. Visible external activity in the form of the external distributions was a real advantage, with <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://belenix.sarovar.org/">BeleniX</a></span> getting particular interest.</li></ul><p><strong>Contributions: Code</strong></p><ul><li>We've had eight code contributions put back into OpenSolaris via the <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+on/becoming%2Da%2Dsponsor">request-sponsor</a></span> program in March.

Also thanks to the Sun engineers for sponsoring the code to through to putback: Sara Jelinek, Darren Moffat, Dan Mick, Dan Price, Dana Myers, Rao Shoaib, Minskey Guo, and Dave Miner. Robert Milkowsk's fix (#45) led to a PSARC case.</li><li>Since we opened on June 14, 2005, we have a total of 92 code contributions offered to OpenSolaris. Forty seven have been integrated, 17 are in progress, and only three are awaiting sponsors.

The first Brand is 'lx', which emulates Linux. The project has been open since December 2005. Since then we've released several updates and have taken some code contributions. Recently, Juergen Hannken-Illjes fixed three bugs that were impacting applications he was trying to run under BrandZ:</p><ul><li>6389317 clone()d threads using stdio may segmentation fault glibc</li><li>6353934 SIOCGIFNAME must return Linux device names in BrandZ</li><li>6391195 clone() CLONE_THREAD fails to return created thread id to caller</li></ul><p>&nbsp;The first two fixes are currently available in the BrandZ project releases, and the third will be integrated in a few weeks. All three will be included with our final integration into OpenSolaris. - Edward Pilatowicz</p><p><strong>Conferences</strong></p><ul><li>OpenSolaris participated in the 2006 China ERC.
