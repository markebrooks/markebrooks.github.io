11: === Abstract:
12: 
13:  This document proposes a new resource control facility for the SolarisTM Operating Environment, called //CPU Caps//. This facility provides hard fine-grained limit for the amount of CPU resources that can be used by all user processes within a project or a zone. The //CPU Caps// facility complements existing resource control facilities like the Fair Share Scheduler, resource pools and others.
14: 
15:  The document describes the motivation for limiting CPU resources, the functional requirements, provide a short implementation overview and discuss observability issues. We also show suggested changes to the existing SolarisTMdocumentation.
16: 
17:  The on-line version of this paper is available in [[[1&#62;&#62;#opensolaris:cpucaps]]].
18: 
19: =  1 Introduction
20: 
21:  Customers running SolarisTMsystem in data centers often require facilities to partition a systems into smaller subsystems. This allows various departments or projects to share the single system gracefully. One of the most important system resources is the CPU time. Without good CPU partitioning, CPU-hungry software may starve others from the valuable cycles.
22: 
23:  Solaris provides different mechanisms which can be used to control CPU usage of applications:
24: 
25: * Processor binding (see [[pbind(1M)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqbg?a=view]] ) provides a way to limit process or a set of processes to a single CPU. It allows other unbound threads to run on the same CPU and compete for CPU cycles with bound threads.
26: * Processor sets (see [[psrset(1M)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqd0?a=view]] ) provide a way to limit process execution to a set of CPUs. It also prohibits threads not belonging to the set from running within the set.
27: * Dynamic resource pools (see [[pooladm(1M)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqbv?a=view]] ) integrate processor sets with Zones.
28: * Fair Share Scheduler (see [[FSS(7)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5177/6mbbc4g5u?a=view]] ) provides a mechanism to share available CPUs within given proportions (shares). The //Fair Share Scheduler// only controls CPU usage relative to CPU usage of other applications. CPU shares do not limit CPU usage when there are idle CPU resources.
29: 
30:  CPU binding and processor sets provide //hard// limits for applications since they can not run outside a bound CPU or a set, but the minimum granularity for both is a single CPU. The [[FSS(7)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5177/6mbbc4g5u?a=view]] provides //soft// limits which are enforced only when there is enough competition for CPU resources and is specified in units expressing relationships of processes to each other and not in units related to the number of CPUs. Various customers requested a way to provide a limit on CPU usage that can not be exceeded (//hard//) and that can be specified in fractions of a CPU (//fine-grained//). For practical purposes it is enough to provide such limit to zones or projects - it does not seem to be very useful to provide such limit for individual processes or threads.
31: 
32:  Customers provided the following major reasons for having such hard fine-grained CPU usage limits:
33: 
34: * Selling CPU resources.
35:  Customers selling their CPU resources want to provide usage limits based on the amount of CPU power purchased.
36: * Managing expectations.
37:  Customers want the clients buying CPU resources to have the same experience in terms of their application performance independent of the machine load. With the FSS, clients, running their applications on otherwise idle machine, will see better performance and may expect to get the same level of performance on the loaded machine. Hard limits provide the same performance levels even when there are idle CPUs.
38: * Over-subscription
39:  Some customers want to use hard limits as a mechanism to over-subscribe users. They may sell more CPU resource than what is available and they will be able to provide the level of service unless they run out of CPU cycles in which case there will be some decline in performance. For example, on a four-CPU machine they may sell 125% of a CPU to four customers. If all four customers make full use of their CPU resources, they will only get 100% of a CPU, but when some CPU resources are available they will get close to 125%.
40: 
41:  In some form such mechanism for limiting CPU resources is provided by other operating systems (see section [[2.1&#62;&#62;#sec:competition]] //CPU Caps on other systems//). It became one of many checkbox items which customers look at when comparing resource management solutions from Sun and other vendors.
42: 
43:  To provide such facility, Solaris needs a new mechanism which provides a hard CPU usage cap which is enforced even if some CPUs are idle. This is a stronger performance guarantee than the one, provided by FSS shares, where the end result greatly depends on other workloads that run on the system at the same time. Such mechanism should have low enough overhead and not penalize users who do not wish to use it.
44: 
45:  This paper describes such mechanism, called //CPU caps//, which allows system administrators to define a hard upper limit (or a cap) on how much CPU time can be consumed by applications. The cap can be specified in fractions of a single CPU. It can be set for any //project// or //zone// using two new resource controls project.cpu-cap and zone.cpu-cap. The cap value is a percentage of a single CPU that all threads belonging to the project or zone can consume. For example, if zone CPU cap is set to 50, then that zone is only allowed to use one half of a single processor (on a 2-CPU system that zone is allowed to use 25% of all CPUs). Note that, unlike processor binding and processor sets, applications in capped projects or zones can run on any valid CPU and their combined CPU usage is capped.
46: 
47:  In the rest of this document we define the requirements, show some usage examples, discuss observability and other issues and, finally, propose changes to existing documentation.
48: 
49: =  2 Requirements
50: 
51:  The discussion above forms the basis for the requirements. Here we discuss in more detail the functionality, accuracy, observability and other requirements.
52: 
53: * Functionality
54:  For any project or zone with a cap set to C the combined usage of all LWPs running in that project or zone should not exceed C% of a single CPU. It should be possible to set project caps for projects belonging to capped zones.
55: * Orthogonality
56:  CPU caps should be orthogonal to all other system facilities. In particular, it should be compatible with all supported scheduling classes. For practical reasons the //Real-Time// (RT) scheduling class ignores all CPU caps.
57:  It should be also compatible with resource shares. For example, a zone may have CPU cap set to 50% and have all of its CPU cycles distributed between its project according to their CPU shares. Or, a project may have cap and shares set. When cap is reached, project should get scheduled less frequently, and it should still be scheduled according to the ratio between the amount of its shares and shares of all other active projects running on the same processor set in its zone.
58:  CPU caps should also be compatible with resource pools which limit the CPUs that can be used by a zone. CPU caps will additionally limit the CPU consumption within a pool. One application of this may be setting up several capped projects within a pool.
59: * Accuracy
60:  CPU caps must be accurate as much as practically possible. We aim at providing accuracy within 1% of the overall CPU capacity.
61: * Stability
62:  The adjustments performed by the CPU caps enforcement mechanisms should be careful to preserve system load stability. Given a stable workload the capped system should provide stable load levels and small changes in the workload load should lead to small changes in the system load. The implementation should be careful to avoid oscillating system load.
63: * Observability
64:  CPU caps should provide enough observability for users to estimate an impact of CPU limits on specific applications. It should also provide users ways to determine estimated CPU usage requirements.
65: * Performance impact
66:  There should be no visible performance impact when CPU caps are not used (there are no projects or zones with defined caps). When caps are enabled, but not reached, the impact on performance (mostly caused by extra accounting work that needs to be done) should be as little as possible. When caps are enabled and get reached by projects/zones, their threads will get scheduled less often anyway so it&#8217;s hard to make any performance guarantees about that case.

68: ==   2.1 CPU Caps on other systems
69: 
70: ===  2.1.1 CPU Caps on Linux
71: 
72:  Linux has patches against 2.6.17 kernel provided by Aurema that implement per-task CPU caps. Capping for task aggregation is not currently supported. Child tasks inherit the cap value from the parent. It seems that Linux implementation includes some of the FSS concepts by providing the notion of ``soft cap&#8217;&#8217; which can be exceeded if there is some idle CPU time.

77: 
78: ===  2.1.2 CPU Caps on HP/UX
79: 
80:  HP-UX provides CPU caps via the WLM workload manager. CPU caps can not be used with shares at the same time. When caps are turned on, the number of shares becomes a cap. More information about the HP support for CPU caps is available at [[http://docs.hp.com/en/B8733-90017/ch02s02.html#cjadichh&#62;&#62;http://docs.hp.com/en/B8733-90017/ch02s02.html#cjadichh]].
81: 
82: ===  2.1.3 CPU Caps on AIX
83: 
84:  AIX 5L workload manager redbook at [[http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg245977.pdf&#62;&#62;http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg245977.pdf]] provides info on what AIX WLM can do. They provide hard and soft CPU limits which can be used in combination with shares.. Read pp47-49 for details.
85: 
86: =   3 Administrative Interface
87: 
88:  CPU caps can be set and enforced for projects and zones. The cap value is specified in units of one per cent of a CPU. For example, a CPU cap of 50 limits CPU resources to 50% of one CPU regardless of how many CPUs are available and their characteristics.
89: 
90:  A zone CPU caps is represented by the zone.cpu-cap resource control. A project CPU cap is represented by the project.cpu-cap resource control. Caps are only enforced when //privileged// limits are set[[1&#62;&#62;#foot105]]. These resource controls can be set statically for projects in [[project(4)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5174/6mbb98uiu?a=view]] file and for zones using [[zonecfg(1M)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqm2?a=view]] command. They can be also modified or removed on a running system using [[prctl(1)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9p6?a=view]] utility. The cap value should be greater than zero[[2&#62;&#62;#foot336]].
91: 
92: ==   3.1 Project CPU caps
93: 
94:  A project CPU cap is represented by the project.cpu-cap resource control. It is associated with the //privileged level// and can be modified only by privileged (superuser) callers (see [[resource_controls(5)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5175/6mbba7f37?a=view]] and [[prctl(1)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9p6?a=view]] for the description of //privileged level//).
95: 
96:  The project.cpu-cap resource limit can be set statically for projects in [[project(4)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5174/6mbb98uiu?a=view]] file. For example, the following line in [[project(4)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5174/6mbb98uiu?a=view]] file sets persistent CPU cap of 6 CPUs for user akolb:
97: 
98: {{{
99: 
100: user.akolb:1234::::project.cpu-cap=(privileged,600,none)
101: 
102: }}}
103: 
104:  Project CPU cap can be also dynamically modified or removed on a running system using [[prctl(1)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9p6?a=view]] utility. For example, the following command modifies the CPU cap to limit user akolb to 3 CPUs:
105: 
106: {{{
107: 
108: $ prctl -r -t privileged -n project.cpu-cap -v 300 -i project user.akolb
109: 
110: }}}
111: 
112:  To remove a project cap the following command can be used:
113: 
114: {{{
115: 
116: $ prctl -x -n project.cpu-cap $$
117: 
118: }}}
119: 
120:  To dynamically change CPU caps for projects or zones, use -r (``replace&#8217;&#8217;)[[3&#62;&#62;#foot338]] option for the [[prctl(1)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9p6?a=view]] command. For example, the following command will change the cap set above to 80%:
121: 
122: {{{
123: 
124: $ prctl -r -t privileged -n project.cpu-cap -v 80 -i project group.staff
125: 
126: }}}
127: 
128:  Adding the following line to /etc/project file:
129: 
130: ===   3.2 Zone CPU cap
131: 
132:  A zone CPU caps is represented by the zone.cpu-cap resource control. Similar to the project cap it is associated with the //privileged level// and can be modified only by privileged (superuser) callers.
133: 
134:  The zone.cpu-cap resource can be set for a zone using [[zonecfg(1M)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqm2?a=view]] command. The following example configures CPU cap for a zone to 3 CPUs:
135: 
136: {{{
137: 
138: zonecfg:myzone&#62; add rctl
139: zonecfg:myzone:rctl&#62; set name=zone.cpu-cap
140: zonecfg:myzone:rctl&#62; add value (priv=privileged,limit=300,action=none)
141: zonecfg:myzone:rctl&#62; end
142: 
143: }}}
144: 
145:  The zone cap can be dynamically changed using [[resource_controls(5)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5175/6mbba7f37?a=view]] command. For example, the following command sets zone CPU cap for zone ``zone1&#8217;&#8217; to 80% of a CPU:
146: 
147: {{{
148: 
149: $ prctl -t privileged -n zone.cpu-cap -v 80 -i zone global
150: 
151: }}}
152: 
153:  This cap can be changed to 50% later using the following command:
154: 
155: {{{
156: 
157: $ prctl -r -t privileged -n zone.cpu-cap -v 50 -i zone global
158: 
159: }}}
160: 
161: ===  3.3  [[zonecfg(1M)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqm2?a=view]] extensions for CPU caps
162: 
163:  The [[zonecfg(1M)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqm2?a=view]] is extended with a new resource called capped-cpu, as described in PSARC/2006/496 [[[3&#62;&#62;#PSARC2006496]]]. The resource value, called ncpus, maps to the zone.cpu-cap rctl. This case formalizes the proposal from PSARC/2006/496 [[[3&#62;&#62;#PSARC2006496]]] and commits to this new interface.
164: 
165:  The capped-cpu resource has a single ncpus property which is a positive decimal with two digits to the right of the decimal. This property is implemented as a special case of the zonecfg cpu-cap alias. The special case handling of this property normalizes the value so that it corresponds to units of cpus and is similar to the ncpus property under the dedicated-cpu resource group. Unlike dedicated-cpu it will not accept a range and it will accept a decimal number. For example, when using ncpus in the dedicated-cpu resource group, a value of 1 means one dedicated cpu. When using ncpus in the capped-cpu resource group, a value of 1 means 100% of a cpu as the zone.cpu-cap setting. A value of 1.25 means 125%, since 100% corresponds to one full cpu on the system when using cpu caps. The intention here is to align the ncpus units as closely as possible in these two cases (dedicated-cpu vs. capped-cpu), given the limitations and capabilities of the two underlying mechanisms (pset vs. rctl). See PSARC/2006/496 [[[3&#62;&#62;#PSARC2006496]]] for a description of the dedicated-cpu resource and ncpu property.
166: 
167:  The following example sets zone CPU cap using the capped-cpu resource:
168: 
169: {{{
170: 
171:   zonecfg:myzone&#62; add capped-cpu
172:   zonecfg:myzone&#62;capped-cpu&#62; set ncpus=3
173:   zonecfg:myzone&#62;capped-cpu&#62;capped-cpu&#62; end
174:

177: =  4 Implementation Overview
178: 
179:  Here we provide a short overview of CPU caps implementation. See the implementation guide [[[2&#62;&#62;#opensolaris:implementation]]] for more details.
180: 
181:  A CPU cap can be set for any project or any zone. Zone CPU caps limits the CPU usage for all projects running inside the zone. If the zone CPU cap is set below the project CPU cap, the latter will have no effect.
182: 
183:  For all threads running in capped projects or zones, the system keeps track of their CPU usage over short periods of time. When CPU usage of projects or zones reaches specified caps, threads in them do not get scheduled and instead are placed on the special //wait queues// in the kernel. These threads will become runnable again only when CPU usage drops below the cap level.
184: 
185:  Each zone and each project has its own //wait queue//. The time spent by threads on //wait queues// is reported as ``//wait-cpu//&#8217;&#8217; (latency) time by //procfs//[[4&#62;&#62;#foot343]]. Wait times can be seen in the LAT column when [[prstat(1M)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqcm?a=view]] is invoked with the -m option. CPU time spent by threads on wait queues is also accumulated at the LMS_WAIT_CPU micro-state accounting state[[5&#62;&#62;#foot173]]. This time, however, is not accounted for when calculating CPU load averages, unlike the time spent by threads in runnable (waiting on run queues) state. There is no separate accounting for time spent on //wait queues//.
186: 
187:  We decided to combine the wait times that threads spent waiting on //run queues// and //wait queues// into a single bucket because currently there is a fixed set of micro-state accounting types. Any extension of this set will cause offsets of fields in data structures, embedding micro-state data, to change. This, in turn, implies that all [[proc(4)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5174/6mbb98uiq?a=view]] consumers should be recompiled. We feel that CPU wait time is general enough to include time spent waiting on both //run queues // and //wait queues// and it is reasonable to combine them together until micro-state accounting framework is extended.
188: 
189:  All CPU usage accounting data is collected using micro-state accounting facility and the provided accuracy depends on the accuracy of the micro-state data. The per-thread CPU usage is aggregated to project usage and the project usage is accumulated to zone usage. The implementation uses a decay formula that decays one per cent of the value on every clock tick.
190: 
191:  Once a CPU usage of a project or zone is exceeded, all user threads running there are marked with a special flag. The preemption code places them on //wait queues// once they cross the user-kernel boundary.
192: 
193:  CPU caps are enforced only for threads running in //TS//, //IA//, //FX//, and //FSS// scheduling classes. CPU Cap on threads running in //RT// (Real-Time) scheduling class has no effect.
194: 
195: =   5 CPU Caps Observability
196: 
197:  There are several ways to observe the impact of CPU caps at a zone or project level and at a process or thread level. Each project or zone CPU cap exports information via kstats (see [[5.1&#62;&#62;#observability:kstat]]).
198: 
199:  The DTrace sched provider is extended with two new probes which can be used for gathering detailed data for times spent on wait queues (see [[5.3&#62;&#62;#dtrace]]). These probes provide thread and process level observability for CPU caps.
200: 
201: ==   5.1 Zones and Project observability
202: 
203:  Zone and project CPU cap kstats contain the following information:
204: 
205: ; **value**
206: : - the cap value in percentages of a single CPU
207: ; **usage**
208: : - current aggregated CPU usage for all threads belonging to a capped project or zone in percentages of a single CPU
209: ; **maxusage**
210: : - maximum observed CPU usage
211: ; **above_sec**
212: : - total time in seconds spent above the cap
213: ; **below_sec**
214: : - total time in seconds spent below the cap
215: ; **nwait**
216: : - number of threads on cap wait queue
217: 
218:  For example, when a project CPU cap is set to 50% for project 1234, the following command will show cap information:
219: 
220: {{{
221: 
222: $ kstat -m caps
223: module: caps instance: 0
224: name:   cpucaps_project_1234 class: project_caps
225:         above_sec    787
226:         below_sec    260551
227:         nwait        0
228:         usage        1
229:         maxusage     51
230:         value        50
231: 
232: }}}
233: 
234:  The following example is for zone kstats:
235: 
236: {{{
237: 
238: module: caps instance: 14
239: name:   cpucaps_zone_14 class: zone_caps
240:         above_sec  0
241:         below_sec  3
242:         maxusage   255
243:         nwait      0
244:         usage      19
245:         value      300
246: 
247: }}}
248: 
249:  For both zone and project kstats, the kstat instance is the same as zone ID. The PSARC 2006/598 //Swap resource control// case[[[4&#62;&#62;#PSARC2006598]]] provides a precedents for such kstats and establishes the naming conventions.
250: 
251:  The maximum usage statistics provides a good way for users to estimate how to set up their CPU caps. They can set the cap to a very high value and observe the maximum usage while their application is running for a while. This gives an estimate of maximum CPU requirements for the workload.
252: 
253:  The kstat instance ID is always equal to the zone ID. The global zone will see kstats for all zones, while non global zones will only see kstats with matching zoneid.
254: 
255:  When a cap is set on a zone, all projects within this zone are automatically capped, but their kstats will show the cap value of zero (unless some of these projects have specific caps of their own). Projects with the cap value of zero participate in zone CPU usage accounting, but are not actually used to enforce project caps. For example, on a system with zone cap set on zone 1 and project cap set for project 10 in global zone:
256: 
257: {{{
258: 
259: kstat caps
260: module: caps instance: 0

275:   maxusage     10
276:   value        0

291:   nwait        3
292:   usage        50
293:   maxusage     51
294:   value        50
295: 
296: }}}
297: 
298:  As we can see, there are two projects belonging to zone 1 and three threads are waiting on the zone cap because the zone has reached its limit[[6&#62;&#62;#foot202]].
299: 
300:  The kstat(1M) command running in a zone only shows CPU caps relevant for that zone and its projects. We can use various modifications of kstat(1M) command to examine only project or zone caps.
301: 
302:  For example,
303: 
304: {{{
305: 
306: #
307: # Show project caps only
308: #
309: $ kstat -c project_caps
310: #
311: # Show project caps for zone 1
312: #
313: $ kstat -c project_caps -i 1
314: 
315: }}}
316: 
317:  The similar observability kstats are also introduced by the //Swap resource control// [[[4&#62;&#62;#PSARC2006598]]] project.
318: 
319: ==  5.2 Thread level observability
320: 
321:  The [[ps(1)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9pk?a=view]] command shows threads on the wait queue by displaying ``W&#8217;&#8217; for their state. For example:
322: 
323: {{{
324: 
325: $ ps -o pid,s,comm -p 101262

330: 
331:  The [[prstat(1M)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqcm?a=view]] command shows //``wait&#8217;&#8217;// state for threads, sitting on wait queues. For example:
332:

337: 
338: }}}
339: 
340: ==   5.3 DTrace changes for CPU caps
341: 
342:  CPU caps provide two new DTrace sched provider probes for observing scheduling impact for threads and processes:
343: 
344: ; **cpucaps-sleep**
345: : Probe that fires immediately before the current thread is placed on a wait queue. The lwpsinfo_t of the waiting thread is pointed to by args[0]. The psinfo_t of the process containing the waiting thread is pointed to by args[1].
346: ; **cpucaps-wakeup**
347: : Probe that fires immediately after a thread is removed from a wait queue. The lwpsinfo_t of the waiting thread is pointed to by args[0]. The psinfo_t of the process containing the waiting thread is pointed to by args[1].
348: 
349:  For example, the following D script shows the number of seconds processes spend on CPU and on wait queues. It an reasonable estimate of which process and to what extent are affected by CPU caps.
350: 
351: {{{
352:

405: 
406:  This script was running for a while on a system which has 40% project cap set and two CPU bound processes running in a project:

420: cpudrain-amd       373
421: 
422: }}}
423: 
424:  As we can see, each of the two processes spends 20% of its time on CPU and 80% on wait queue, so together they use 40% of a single CPU which is exactly what the cap allows them.
425: 
426: =   6 Issues
427: 
428: ==  6.1 Accounting accuracy
429: 
430:  There is some inherent error in the usage accounting performed by the system. Even micro-state accounting is not 100% correct[[7&#62;&#62;#foot348]]. The CPU usage is aggregated for all threads running in a capped project or zone. When the system is executing many threads within a project or a zone, the aggregated usage error may increase significantly and noticeably reduce accuracy of the CPU caps.
431: 
432: ==  6.2 Dedicated micro-state for wait queues
433: 
434:  Due to the non-extensible nature of micro-state accounting, the current design uses LMS_WAIT_CPU micro-state is used to keep track of both on-waitq and on-runq CPU times. There is no separate micro-state for wait time only. Addition of any extra states requires recompilation of many existing tools that read and process /proc data. Still, the observability hooks described in [[5&#62;&#62;#sec:observability]] provide enough tools to get around this issue.
435: 
436: ==  6.3 Interrupts and pinned threads
437: 
438:  Threads which get pinned by interrupt threads don&#8217;t change their micro-states. Clock tick processing won&#8217;t happen for pinned threads, but it might look like they&#8217;ve used more CPU time than they actually did just by looking at their micro-state counters. This is a generic micro-state accounting problem though.

570: : See [[resource_controls(5)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5175/6mbba7f37?a=view]] and [[prctl(1)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9p6?a=view]] for the description of privileged limits.
571: ; ... zero[[2&#62;&#62;#tex2html16]]
572: : Because of bug [[6468451&#62;&#62;http://bugs.opensolaris.org/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6468451]] [[prctl(1)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9p6?a=view]] will not complain when the cap value is set to zero, but the kernel will ignore such attempt. As a result, [[prctl(1)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9p6?a=view]] will show the resource value as being zero.
573: ; ... (``replace&#8217;&#8217;)[[3&#62;&#62;#tex2html23]]
574: : An attempt to change CPU cap by setting privileged resource to the new value will create two values of the resource while only one of them is active. To avoid confusion it is best to always replace the old resource value with -r option given to [[prctl(1)&#62;&#62;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9p6?a=view]] .
575: ; ...procfs[[4&#62;&#62;#tex2html35]]

577: ; ... state[[5&#62;&#62;#tex2html37]]
578: : Currently there is a fixed set of micro-state accounting types. Any extension of this set will cause offsets of fields in data structures, embedding micro-state data, to change.
579: ; ... limit[[6&#62;&#62;#tex2html40]]
580: : In the kstat output the combined project usage for a zone may not be the same as zone usage due to rounding error. Internally usage is kept as nanoseconds per tick and is rounded to the integer percentage value.
