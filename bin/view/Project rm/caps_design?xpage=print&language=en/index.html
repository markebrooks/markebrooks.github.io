This facility provides hard fine-grained limit for the amount of CPU resources that can be used by all user processes within a project or a zone. The <em>CPU Caps</em> facility complements existing resource control facilities like the Fair Share Scheduler, resource pools and others.</p><p>&nbsp;The document describes the motivation for limiting CPU resources, the functional requirements, provide a short implementation overview and discuss observability issues. We also show suggested changes to the existing SolarisTMdocumentation.</p><p>&nbsp;The on-line version of this paper is available in <!--startwikilink:#opensolaris:cpucaps--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#opensolaris:cpucaps">[1</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->].</p><h1 id="H1Introduction"><span>1 Introduction</span></h1><p>&nbsp;Customers running SolarisTMsystem in data centers often require facilities to partition a systems into smaller subsystems. This allows various departments or projects to share the single system gracefully. One of the most important system resources is the CPU time. Without good CPU partitioning, CPU-hungry software may starve others from the valuable cycles.</p><p>&nbsp;Solaris provides different mechanisms which can be used to control CPU usage of applications:</p><ul><li>Processor binding (see <!--startwikilink:http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqbg?a=view--><span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqbg?a=view">pbind(1M)</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> ) provides a way to limit process or a set of processes to a single CPU. It allows other unbound threads to run on the same CPU and compete for CPU cycles with bound threads.</li><li>Processor sets (see <!--startwikilink:http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqd0?a=view--><span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqd0?a=view">psrset(1M)</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> ) provide a way to limit process execution to a set of CPUs. It also prohibits threads not belonging to the set from running within the set.</li><li>Dynamic resource pools (see <!--startwikilink:http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqbv?a=view--><span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqbv?a=view">pooladm(1M)</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> ) integrate processor sets with Zones.</li><li>Fair Share Scheduler (see <!--startwikilink:http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5177/6mbbc4g5u?a=view--><span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5177/6mbbc4g5u?a=view">FSS(7)</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> ) provides a mechanism to share available CPUs within given proportions (shares). The <em>Fair Share Scheduler</em> only controls CPU usage relative to CPU usage of other applications. CPU shares do not limit CPU usage when there are idle CPU resources.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;CPU binding and processor sets provide <em>hard</em> limits for applications since they can not run outside a bound CPU or a set, but the minimum granularity for both is a single CPU. The <!--startwikilink:http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5177/6mbbc4g5u?a=view--><span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5177/6mbbc4g5u?a=view">FSS(7)</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> provides <em>soft</em> limits which are enforced only when there is enough competition for CPU resources and is specified in units expressing relationships of processes to each other and not in units related to the number of CPUs. Various customers requested a way to provide a limit on CPU usage that can not be exceeded (<em>hard</em>) and that can be specified in fractions of a CPU (<em>fine-grained</em>). For practical purposes it is enough to provide such limit to zones or projects - it does not seem to be very useful to provide such limit for individual processes or threads.</p><p>&nbsp;Customers provided the following major reasons for having such hard fine-grained CPU usage limits:</p><ul><li>Selling CPU resources.<br/>&nbsp;Customers selling their CPU resources want to provide usage limits based on the amount of CPU power purchased.</li><li>Managing expectations.<br/>&nbsp;Customers want the clients buying CPU resources to have the same experience in terms of their application performance independent of the machine load. With the FSS, clients, running their applications on otherwise idle machine, will see better performance and may expect to get the same level of performance on the loaded machine. Hard limits provide the same performance levels even when there are idle CPUs.</li><li>Over-subscription<br/>&nbsp;Some customers want to use hard limits as a mechanism to over-subscribe users. They may sell more CPU resource than what is available and they will be able to provide the level of service unless they run out of CPU cycles in which case there will be some decline in performance. For example, on a four-CPU machine they may sell 125% of a CPU to four customers. If all four customers make full use of their CPU resources, they will only get 100% of a CPU, but when some CPU resources are available they will get close to 125%.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;In some form such mechanism for limiting CPU resources is provided by other operating systems (see section <!--startwikilink:#sec:competition--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#sec:competition">2.1</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> <em>CPU Caps on other systems</em>). It became one of many checkbox items which customers look at when comparing resource management solutions from Sun and other vendors.</p><p>&nbsp;To provide such facility, Solaris needs a new mechanism which provides a hard CPU usage cap which is enforced even if some CPUs are idle. This is a stronger performance guarantee than the one, provided by FSS shares, where the end result greatly depends on other workloads that run on the system at the same time. Such mechanism should have low enough overhead and not penalize users who do not wish to use it.</p><p>&nbsp;This paper describes such mechanism, called <em>CPU caps</em>, which allows system administrators to define a hard upper limit (or a cap) on how much CPU time can be consumed by applications. The cap can be specified in fractions of a single CPU. It can be set for any <em>project</em> or <em>zone</em> using two new resource controls project.cpu-cap and zone.cpu-cap. The cap value is a percentage of a single CPU that all threads belonging to the project or zone can consume. For example, if zone CPU cap is set to 50, then that zone is only allowed to use one half of a single processor (on a 2-CPU system that zone is allowed to use 25% of all CPUs). Note that, unlike processor binding and processor sets, applications in capped projects or zones can run on any valid CPU and their combined CPU usage is capped.</p><p>&nbsp;In the rest of this document we define the requirements, show some usage examples, discuss observability and other issues and, finally, propose changes to existing documentation.</p><h1 id="H2Requirements"><span>2 Requirements</span></h1><p>&nbsp;The discussion above forms the basis for the requirements. Here we discuss in more detail the functionality, accuracy, observability and other requirements.</p><ul><li>Functionality<br/>&nbsp;For any project or zone with a cap set to C the combined usage of all LWPs running in that project or zone should not exceed C% of a single CPU. It should be possible to set project caps for projects belonging to capped zones.</li><li>Orthogonality<br/>&nbsp;CPU caps should be orthogonal to all other system facilities. In particular, it should be compatible with all supported scheduling classes. For practical reasons the <em>Real-Time</em> (RT) scheduling class ignores all CPU caps.<br/>&nbsp;It should be also compatible with resource shares. For example, a zone may have CPU cap set to 50% and have all of its CPU cycles distributed between its project according to their CPU shares. Or, a project may have cap and shares set. When cap is reached, project should get scheduled less frequently, and it should still be scheduled according to the ratio between the amount of its shares and shares of all other active projects running on the same processor set in its zone.<br/>&nbsp;CPU caps should also be compatible with resource pools which limit the CPUs that can be used by a zone. CPU caps will additionally limit the CPU consumption within a pool. One application of this may be setting up several capped projects within a pool.</li><li>Accuracy<br/>&nbsp;CPU caps must be accurate as much as practically possible. We aim at providing accuracy within 1% of the overall CPU capacity.</li><li>Stability<br/>&nbsp;The adjustments performed by the CPU caps enforcement mechanisms should be careful to preserve system load stability. Given a stable workload the capped system should provide stable load levels and small changes in the workload load should lead to small changes in the system load. The implementation should be careful to avoid oscillating system load.</li><li>Observability<br/>&nbsp;CPU caps should provide enough observability for users to estimate an impact of CPU limits on specific applications. It should also provide users ways to determine estimated CPU usage requirements.</li><li>Performance impact<br/>&nbsp;There should be no visible performance impact when CPU caps are not used (there are no projects or zones with defined caps). When caps are enabled, but not reached, the impact on performance (mostly caused by extra accounting work that needs to be done) should be as little as possible. When caps are enabled and get reached by projects/zones, their threads will get scheduled less often anyway so it's hard to make any performance guarantees about that case.</li></ul><h2 id="H21CPUCapsonothersystems"><span>2.1 CPU Caps on other systems</span></h2><h3 id="H211CPUCapsonLinux"><span>2.1.1 CPU Caps on Linux</span></h3><p>&nbsp;Linux has patches against 2.6.17 kernel provided by Aurema that implement per-task CPU caps. Capping for task aggregation is not currently supported. Child tasks inherit the cap value from the parent. It seems that Linux implementation includes some of the FSS concepts by providing the notion of ``soft cap'' which can be exceeded if there is some idle CPU time.

</pre><p>&nbsp;To dynamically change CPU caps for projects or zones, use -r (``replace'')<!--startwikilink:#foot338--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#foot338">3</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> option for the <!--startwikilink:http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9p6?a=view--><span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9p6?a=view">prctl(1)</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> command. For example, the following command will change the cap set above to 80%:</p><pre>

$ prctl -r -t privileged -n project.cpu-cap -v 80 -i project group.staff

</pre><p>&nbsp;Adding the following line to /etc/project file:</p><h3 id="H32ZoneCPUcap"><span>3.2 Zone CPU cap</span></h3><p>&nbsp;A zone CPU caps is represented by the zone.cpu-cap resource control.

The following example configures CPU cap for a zone to 3 CPUs:</p><pre>

The resource value, called ncpus, maps to the zone.cpu-cap rctl. This case formalizes the proposal from PSARC/2006/496 <!--startwikilink:#PSARC2006496--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#PSARC2006496">[3</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->] and commits to this new interface.</p><p>&nbsp;The capped-cpu resource has a single ncpus property which is a positive decimal with two digits to the right of the decimal. This property is implemented as a special case of the zonecfg cpu-cap alias. The special case handling of this property normalizes the value so that it corresponds to units of cpus and is similar to the ncpus property under the dedicated-cpu resource group. Unlike dedicated-cpu it will not accept a range and it will accept a decimal number. For example, when using ncpus in the dedicated-cpu resource group, a value of 1 means one dedicated cpu. When using ncpus in the capped-cpu resource group, a value of 1 means 100% of a cpu as the zone.cpu-cap setting. A value of 1.25 means 125%, since 100% corresponds to one full cpu on the system when using cpu caps. The intention here is to align the ncpus units as closely as possible in these two cases (dedicated-cpu vs. capped-cpu), given the limitations and capabilities of the two underlying mechanisms (pset vs. rctl). See PSARC/2006/496 <!--startwikilink:#PSARC2006496--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#PSARC2006496">[3</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->] for a description of the dedicated-cpu resource and ncpu property.</p><p>&nbsp;The following example sets zone CPU cap using the capped-cpu resource:</p><pre>

  zonecfg:myzone&gt; add capped-cpu
  zonecfg:myzone&gt;capped-cpu&gt; set ncpus=3
  zonecfg:myzone&gt;capped-cpu&gt;capped-cpu&gt; end

</pre><h1 id="H4ImplementationOverview"><span>4 Implementation Overview</span></h1><p>&nbsp;Here we provide a short overview of CPU caps implementation. See the implementation guide <!--startwikilink:#opensolaris:implementation--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#opensolaris:implementation">[2</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->] for more details.</p><p>&nbsp;A CPU cap can be set for any project or any zone. Zone CPU caps limits the CPU usage for all projects running inside the zone. If the zone CPU cap is set below the project CPU cap, the latter will have no effect.</p><p>&nbsp;For all threads running in capped projects or zones, the system keeps track of their CPU usage over short periods of time. When CPU usage of projects or zones reaches specified caps, threads in them do not get scheduled and instead are placed on the special <em>wait queues</em> in the kernel. These threads will become runnable again only when CPU usage drops below the cap level.</p><p>&nbsp;Each zone and each project has its own <em>wait queue</em>. The time spent by threads on <em>wait queues</em> is reported as ``<em>wait-cpu</em>'' (latency) time by <em>procfs</em><!--startwikilink:#foot343--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#foot343">4</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->. Wait times can be seen in the LAT column when <!--startwikilink:http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqcm?a=view--><span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqcm?a=view">prstat(1M)</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> is invoked with the -m option. CPU time spent by threads on wait queues is also accumulated at the LMS_WAIT_CPU micro-state accounting state<!--startwikilink:#foot173--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#foot173">5</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->. This time, however, is not accounted for when calculating CPU load averages, unlike the time spent by threads in runnable (waiting on run queues) state. There is no separate accounting for time spent on <em>wait queues</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;We decided to combine the wait times that threads spent waiting on <em>run queues</em> and <em>wait queues</em> into a single bucket because currently there is a fixed set of micro-state accounting types. Any extension of this set will cause offsets of fields in data structures, embedding micro-state data, to change. This, in turn, implies that all <!--startwikilink:http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5174/6mbb98uiq?a=view--><span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5174/6mbb98uiq?a=view">proc(4)</a></span><!--stopwikilink--> consumers should be recompiled. We feel that CPU wait time is general enough to include time spent waiting on both <em>run queues&nbsp;</em> and <em>wait queues</em> and it is reasonable to combine them together until micro-state accounting framework is extended.</p><p>&nbsp;All CPU usage accounting data is collected using micro-state accounting facility and the provided accuracy depends on the accuracy of the micro-state data. The per-thread CPU usage is aggregated to project usage and the project usage is accumulated to zone usage. The implementation uses a decay formula that decays one per cent of the value on every clock tick.</p><p>&nbsp;Once a CPU usage of a project or zone is exceeded, all user threads running there are marked with a special flag. The preemption code places them on <em>wait queues</em> once they cross the user-kernel boundary.</p><p>&nbsp;CPU caps are enforced only for threads running in <em>TS</em>, <em>IA</em>, <em>FX</em>, and <em>FSS</em> scheduling classes. CPU Cap on threads running in <em>RT</em> (Real-Time) scheduling class has no effect.</p><h1 id="H5CPUCapsObservability"><span>5 CPU Caps Observability</span></h1><p>&nbsp;There are several ways to observe the impact of CPU caps at a zone or project level and at a process or thread level. Each project or zone CPU cap exports information via kstats (see <!--startwikilink:#observability:kstat--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#observability:kstat">5.1</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->).</p><p>&nbsp;The DTrace sched provider is extended with two new probes which can be used for gathering detailed data for times spent on wait queues (see <!--startwikilink:#dtrace--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#dtrace">5.3</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->). These probes provide thread and process level observability for CPU caps.</p><h2 id="H51ZonesandProjectobservability"><span>5.1 Zones and Project observability</span></h2><p>&nbsp;Zone and project CPU cap kstats contain the following information:</p><dl><dt><strong>value</strong></dt><dd>- the cap value in percentages of a single CPU</dd><dt><strong>usage</strong></dt><dd>- current aggregated CPU usage for all threads belonging to a capped project or zone in percentages of a single CPU</dd><dt><strong>maxusage</strong></dt><dd>- maximum observed CPU usage</dd><dt><strong>above_sec</strong></dt><dd>- total time in seconds spent above the cap</dd><dt><strong>below_sec</strong></dt><dd>- total time in seconds spent below the cap</dd><dt><strong>nwait</strong></dt><dd>- number of threads on cap wait queue</dd></dl><p>&nbsp;For example, when a project CPU cap is set to 50% for project 1234, the following command will show cap information:</p><pre>

$ kstat -m caps
module: caps instance: 0

        below_sec    260551
        nwait        0
        usage        1
        maxusage     51
        value        50

</pre><p>&nbsp;The following example is for zone kstats:</p><pre>

module: caps instance: 14
name:   cpucaps_zone_14 class: zone_caps
        above_sec  0
        below_sec  3

        nwait      0
        usage      19
        value      300

</pre><p>&nbsp;For both zone and project kstats, the kstat instance is the same as zone ID. The PSARC 2006/598 <em>Swap resource control</em> case<!--startwikilink:#PSARC2006598--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#PSARC2006598">[4</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->] provides a precedents for such kstats and establishes the naming conventions.</p><p>&nbsp;The maximum usage statistics provides a good way for users to estimate how to set up their CPU caps. They can set the cap to a very high value and observe the maximum usage while their application is running for a while. This gives an estimate of maximum CPU requirements for the workload.</p><p>&nbsp;The kstat instance ID is always equal to the zone ID. The global zone will see kstats for all zones, while non global zones will only see kstats with matching zoneid.</p><p>&nbsp;When a cap is set on a zone, all projects within this zone are automatically capped, but their kstats will show the cap value of zero (unless some of these projects have specific caps of their own). Projects with the cap value of zero participate in zone CPU usage accounting, but are not actually used to enforce project caps. For example, on a system with zone cap set on zone 1 and project cap set for project 10 in global zone:</p><pre>

</pre><p>&nbsp;As we can see, there are two projects belonging to zone 1 and three threads are waiting on the zone cap because the zone has reached its limit<!--startwikilink:#foot202--><span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Project+rm/caps_design#foot202">6</a></span><!--stopwikilink-->.</p><p>&nbsp;The kstat(1M) command running in a zone only shows CPU caps relevant for that zone and its projects. We can use various modifications of kstat(1M) command to examine only project or zone caps.</p><p>&nbsp;For example,</p><pre>

The following example shows how much various processes spend on wait queues:</p><pre>

sched:::cpucaps-sleep
{
  sleep[args[1]-&gt;pr_pid] =
    timestamp;
}

sched:::cpucaps-wakeup
/sleep[args[1]-&gt;pr_pid]/
{
  @sleeps[args[1]-&gt;pr_fname] =
    quantize(timestamp - sleep[args[1]-&gt;pr_pid]);
  sleep[args[1]-&gt;pr_pid] = 0;
}

</pre><p>&nbsp;Running the above script results in output similar to the following example:</p><pre>

# ./capswait.d
dtrace: script './capswait.d' matched 2 probes
