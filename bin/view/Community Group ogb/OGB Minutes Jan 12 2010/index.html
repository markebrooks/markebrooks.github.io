Yes.<br/>Front page? Yes, let's make a request to website-discuss in advance. MO takes AI to ping.<br/>Do we know the date by which they need to re-authenticate? This will be date of record.</p><p>Election Calendar<br/>See <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="https://markebrooks.github.io/bin/view/Community+Group+ogb/2010"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">https://markebrooks.github.io/bin/view/Community+Group+ogb/2010</span></a></span><br/>Offset timestamps by one minute to avoid confusion noon vs midnight</p><p>If annual report is to be published on Feb 4th, we don't have much time.<br/>MO - Some have kept good records of accomplishments, report is based on that.<br/>We just need to kick this off at next meeting, otherwise too late.<br/>MO to do a draft by next meeting.<br/>When does annual meeting end? When voting closes, but quorum has to be reached first.</p><p>Val to connect with Steven or Alan Burlison to find out what quorum is. Alan needs to give us a report of how many auth'd Core Contributors there are.<br/>JP takes AI to figure out we have some way to check on whether we have reached quorum in the meeting? Stephen Lau did it last year. <br/>PT: We have to give 10 days' notice of constitution amendment before vote. We only have 9 days in the calendar (23:59 on 26th to 00:00 on 8th)</p><p>???<br/>Move submission date from Friday to Thursday<br/>Do we need to push back beginning of annual meeting? Now have only half day overlap with beginning of voting.<br/>There's no requirement about this.</p><p>Liaison<br/>Lynn &amp; Vincent to join for remaining meetings in our term.<br/>Questions from anyone from the community for exec liaison?</p><p>Peter: What actual future of OpenSolaris community is likely to be?</p><p>Vincent: Lynn has been talking to Oracle community people. From what we've heard, O are interested in all aspects of community and we would hope to see it continue. It is a new company and until CIC happens we don't have info on everything that's going to change.</p><p>Lynn: &nbsp;Have been meeting with O user group responsibles. Their UGs are more customer/user in nature. They're very excited about OpenSolaris and community and are trying to figure out how they can help support and keep moving forward. V. interested in Java User Groups as well. There have been meetings to share info back and forth re different regions, activities. We're working with O identifying communications with OpenSolaris community. Execs on both Sun and O teams will be available to the community to give 30-minute meeting with OGB and UG leaders and commiunity at large during first 1-2 weeks after CIC. Purpose to reassure, tho may not have much info to share right away. Nothing is changing overnight.</p><p>John: Jan 27th EU has to be done with objections, therefore CIC could happen right in the middle of election calendar. There will be a huge need for communication. Does Oracle need to re-ratify charter and/or constitution? Lots of chaos and questions.</p><p>Lynn: No indication at present that there will be any review of OpenSolaris constitutional docs etc. in short term. Can't be accomplished prior to election or even during election time frame. My guess is that things will just move forward as planned with election.</p><p>John: Execs for town halls should be aware that there will be a lot of interest, may be need to replay for different time zones.[film it!]</p><p>JB: #1 thing O can do is strongly reassure the community<br/>Business as usual would be a good way to start the conversation<br/>Valerie people wondering if anyone cares about OpenSolaris code work, is opening more code a priority?</p><p>Lynn: Will take back this feedback, sounds like a need for an FAQ.</p><p>Oracle has a reputation of transitioning IT/MIS quickly, converting infrastructure - will that affect OpenSolaris website and structure?</p><p>Vincent: Re. Opensolaris.org site, no significant change expected.&nbsp;</p><p>Lynn: Have been talking about infrastructure esp for communities. O understands that we have many community sites. Only change on Day 1 will be trademark updates because legally required. Sun is bringing a vast number of Web properties. See OTN (Oracle Tech Net). It cannot support what we do on Opensolaris.org</p><p>Hernan: As a former O employee, experienced the merger with PeopleSoft. At the end it was the same people doing the same things.</p><p>Vincent: Don't see wholesale changes to projects we're looking to deliver. We'd be a bit naive if we thought O wdn't make changes, but they will evaluate benefits that community and product can bring. Their UGs are very different from ours, they have a lot to learn from us. They're smart.</p><p>Hernan: Totally agree. Concerns in Argentina UG are about licensing model O will implement for OpenSolaris, continue with CDDL or put more proprietary conditions? Will it be a totally open source project, or will there be a brand like RedHat, CentOS?</p><p>Vincent: Don't have an immediate answer. The source is all out there today, mostly under CDDL, parts GPL. It would be diff for O to change all that, the community already has the source. It would be possible to look at future developments and decide not to open source them. We're speculating, may not be useful. We need to look at how we can work together to manage transitions. Keep communications channels open, express value of community as well as concerns.</p><p>Peter: Will OpenSolaris continue as a collaborative development community?</p><p>Lynn: Initial feedback is that O understands we have a variety of audiences who make diff types of contributions. They encourage this. They also have developer-oriented outreach including some specialized user groups. Our broad variety brings it to a whole new level - they are looking forward to this.</p><p>MO: Thanks to Lynn and Vincent for joining. Others should bring questions to future meetings. Put messages out to other groups so they can get a sense of today's conversation.</p><hr/><p>Jim's talks with Independent Oracle Users Group (IOUG) <br/>corresponds with what Lynn said. They are interested in interacting with us. Suggest after CIC we should organize a board-to-board meeting with them.</p><p>Lynn: WRT UGs, IOUG is the largest with 100s of regional groups around the world. We are sharing lists of UGs so one immediate outcome would be to connect board members and connect people locally, introduce leaders. Oracle UG Leaders' summit end of this month. If acq closes before that, might be good to have some OGB members there.</p><p>Is this a .com vs. .org thing? We can't know til we try.</p><p>Jim we should have a meeting and go from there.</p><p>John: Next OGB team will need to interact/transition into O world - this will be a large part of next year's OGB activities. We stop being relevant in 1.5 months.</p><p>MO we should summarize and transfer some of this to next OGB via annual report.<br/>John: Our boundary is prepping, but we can't commit next OGB to courses of action.<br/>MO and communicating through the transition.</p><p>Jim : Minute that we plan a board-to-board meeting with IOUG.</p><hr/><p>Process doc updates</p><p>Valerie reviewed, to write up comments so we can put up pages on Genunix.</p><p>JP: Will add the "obvious good" (and well supported by community) comments to the wiki.</p><p>Open question is Peter vs. John electorate question. Maybe just bring it to an OGB vote.</p><p>Let's ignore for 3 days while Peter is busy with his day job.</p><p>Can we draft a motion to vote on in email?</p><p>Let's work on coming up with something that can be decided for next meeting.</p><p>S: convinced that's 2 different ways of looking at same answer. There may be a way to express it such that everyone agrees.</p><p>PT : there's a chance that's true</p><p>PT to draft something</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>JP and VF express concerns about constitutional amendment doc that Jim has. Needs updating. Jim working on it, not sure w need an amendment process. Will be sending via email.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div>
