<h1 id="HTheOpenSolarisConstitution"><span>The OpenSolaris Constitution</span></h1><h2 id="HContext"><span>Context</span></h2><h3 id="HPreamble"><span>Preamble</span></h3><p>The OpenSolaris Community is a world wide open source community dedicated to fostering collaborative development, innovation and adoption of the OpenSolaris operating system and related applications and distributions. All items produced by the OpenSolaris Community shall be licensed to the public free of charge under one or more open source licenses*, such as those* approved by the Open Source Initiative.</p><h3 id="HPurpose"><span>Purpose</span></h3><p>This Constitution defines the operational bylaws of an organization, to be known as the OpenSolaris Community, that has been formed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., via the the <span class="wikilink"><a title="Feb 10, 2006" href="/bin/view/Community+Group+ogb/charter">OpenSolaris Charter</a></span>. The Charter established an OpenSolaris Governing Board (OGB) to manage and direct the OpenSolaris Community, including the construction, ratification, and ongoing maintenance of this Constitution to define membership in the OpenSolaris Community and the procedures by which the Community shall make decisions, adopt new policies, resolve disputes, elect future OGB members, and further amend the Constitution. The Board shall operate transparently, prefer delegation and empowerment, and its members shall strive to be enablers, facilitators, and behind-the-scenes troubleshooters.</p><p>This Constitution limits itself to documenting intent and structure. The authors of this document intentionally moved implementation details into a set of Board-maintained process documents that can evolve as the needs of the community change. The OpenSolaris Constitution must conform to the <span class="wikilink"><a title="Feb 10, 2006" href="/bin/view/Community+Group+ogb/charter">OpenSolaris Charter</a></span>, and any process documents must confirm to both the Charter and to the Constitution.</p><p>References to "Sun Microsystems" and/or "Sun" shall be taken to include "or its successor in interest".</p><hr/><h2 id="H1.CommunityStructure"><span>1. Community Structure</span></h2><p>The OpenSolaris Community is structured as a set of groups of volunteer participants who govern themselves through a meritocracy based on contributions to the community. An Electorate made up of governance minded contributors deals with community-wide issues and annually elects an OpenSolaris Governing Board (OGB). The Governing Board manages and directs the OpenSolaris community as a whole and works to improve upon and advocate in favor of OpenSolaris.</p><h3 id="H1.1Groups"><span><strong>1.1 Groups</strong></span></h3><h4 id="H1.1.1GroupTypes"><span><strong>1.1.1 Group Types</strong></span></h4><p>The OpenSolaris community is made up of groups of people, where each focuses on (and is responsible for) different aspects of the community as a whole. These groups fall into several broad categories based on their scope and/or behavior patterns:</p><ul><li>Communities: Social groups gathered together around issues or technologies.</li><li>Projects: Working groups assembled to collaborate on a distinct cause/effort.</li><li>User Groups: Groups of users, developers, enthusiasts gathered around issues and/or technologies in a specific language or geography.</li></ul><p>The number of groups within a given category can vary greatly, the above list of categories may grow, and there is no implicit hierarchical relationship between them. Each individual group is free to create explicit associations with other groups to facilitate development or other desired community building activities.</p><p>The OGB will maintain a set of <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+ogb/policies">OGB Group Lifecycle Administrative Procedures</a></span> that describe how group Leaders can create, change, archive, and (if needed) reactivate individual groups.</p><h4 id="H1.1.2RolesWithinGroups"><span><strong>1.1.2 Roles Within Groups</strong></span></h4><p>Over time and changing with their involvement, the people who associate together in an OpenSolaris Group assume the following roles:</p><ul><li>A Participant: Anyone registered on opensolaris.org who has designated themselves as being a Participant of a Group. Participants are expected to follow and (as motivated) get involved in the activities of their Group. As their participation evolves from being a passive watcher to a more active player, they will start acquiring merit and reputation based on their contributions.</li><li>A Contributor: Anyone whose acquired merit has been explicitly recognized by the Leaders of a Group as having substantially helped with the goals of that Group. This formal recognition is permanent and can not be taken away. As a meritocracy, Contributors are expected to be the active core of a Group, and have the right to propose and debate matters of interest to their Group as well as become Members of the Electorate (see below).</li><li>A Leader: Anyone responsible for leading a Group. Leaders must be active Contributors in their Groups, reflecting the concept of leadership by a meritocracy. In addition to their usual leadership roles, the Leaders of a group manage the assignment of rights and roles to the members of their Group, including the promotion of Participants into Contributors, Contributors into new Leaders as well as appointing new Facilitators as described below. They also vote on proposals and mediate disputes within their Group, facilitate interactions between their Group and others and represent their Group to the OpenSolaris Community and the Governing Board.</li><li>A Facilitator: Anyone responsible for ensuring that a group's records are properly maintained, communicating the group's status to the OGB, ensuring that communication from the OGB is properly disseminated to their group's participants, and performing the duties of chair for meetings of the group. Facilitators are appointed by the Leaders of the Group they serve or (if needed) by the OGB, which is not limited in their appointment to members of the Group involved.</li></ul><h4 id="H1.1.3GroupManagementProcesses"><span><strong>1.1.3 Group Management Processes</strong></span></h4><p>In order to encourage consistency across the OpenSolaris community and also for the purpose of mediating disputes, groups shall document the procedures they use to manage their activities. This includes development methodologies, voting procedures, participation guidelines, record keeping, requirements for becoming contributors and leaders, etc.</p><p>The Board will maintain a set of <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+ogb/OGB+Group+Management+Guidelines"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">OGB Group Management Guidelines</span></a></span> that can be used to meet this requirement. Groups that desire to use other guidelines must submit them to the OGB for approval.</p><h3 id="H1.2ElectorateGroup"><span><strong>1.2 Electorate Group</strong></span></h3><p>The Electorate is responsible for community wide cross-group governance. Anyone who is a Contributor in an OpenSolaris Group is eligible for membership in the Electorate. In order to provide for an Electorate consisting of current active Contributors, Membership needs to be renewed after two (2) years, or if a Member fails to vote in two (2) consecutive elections.</p><p>The Board will maintain the <span class="wikilink"><a href="/bin/view/Community+Group+ogb/OGB+Electorate+Membership+Process"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">OGB Electorate Membership Process</span></a></span> document describing the qualification and application processes.</p><p>Members of the Electorate are expected to be active participants in the governance of the OpenSolaris Community.
