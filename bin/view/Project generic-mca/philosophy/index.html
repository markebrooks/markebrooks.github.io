<h1 id="HGenericx86MCAErrorPhilosophy"><span>Generic x86 MCA Error Philosophy</span></h1><h2 id="HPublishedRevisionHistory"><span>Published Revision History</span></h2><table><tr><th>Version</th><th>Date</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>1.11</td><td>07/09/12</td></tr><tr><td>1.7</td><td>07/07/30</td><td>First push to OpenSolaris FM Community Website</td></tr></table><h2 id="HIntroduction"><span>Introduction</span></h2><p>&nbsp;We describe the Solaris error-handling philosophy for generic (or "architectural") machine-check architecture (MCA) errors and for vendor-common machine-specific (non-architectural) extensions. This will be implemented in an upcoming putback to Nevada, and backported aiming for Solaris 10 Update 5.</p><p>&nbsp;In [Intel_vol3A] and [AMD_vol2] a generic machine-check architecture is described. This provides for a generic means of discovering and enabling the error-detector banks of a processor, and for collecting error telemetry from these banks and interpreting the impact of the observed error - whether processor context is corrupt etc. We will treat [Intel_vol3A] as the specification for the MCA since it nicely separates what is <em>architectural</em> (defined and available as part of the MCA) and what is <em>model-specific</em>. Between [AMD_vol2] and various model-specific AMD BKDG (Bios &amp; Kernel Developer's Guide) volumes one can see that the AMD MCA implementations do adhere to the Intel architectural aspects of the MCA, perhaps with some small deviations but remaining compatible for our purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;The generic architecture also provides a limited error classification mechanism that allows individual observations to be interpreted in a generic fashion for aspects such as error source - within chip or off chip, within chip cache hierarchy and which cache, etc. Model-specific documentation such as [AMD_BKDG_K8F] may provide detail that can classify an error with much more resolution, such as refining "corrected error from bus/interconnect for a memory read access" to "corrected multiple-bit ChipKill-correctable ECC from main memory, data bits 4 and 6 were bad and corrected"; AMD provides this detail in the public releases of its BKDG, but Intel do not publically document error types in such detail.</p><p>&nbsp;Capturing all model-specific error interpretation is a code-intensive task. Until such support exists in Solaris for a particular cpu model the baseline MCA and FMA support for that model is provided by the generic x86 MCA cpu module cpu.generic. The present document serves as a specification for the required behaviour of cpu.generic for it to implement a respectable baseline level of MCA support for all x86 cpu models supporting MCA.</p><p>&nbsp;The cpu.generic cpu module must limit itself solely to MCA architectural aspects, so that it applies to any x86 cpu model that conforms to the MCA (defined as indicating both MCE and MCA features in CPUID information). It must also provide a means to call into model-specific support (if present) to augment its capabilities such that model-specific support can be achieved without having to write whole new cpu modules - simply layering a new model-specific plugin on top of the canonical cpu.generic should be adequate for most cases.</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;|=CPU Module|=Description</p></blockquote><table><tr><td>cpu.generic</td><td>&nbsp;Default cpu module which applies if no <em>more</em> model-specific cpu module exists or chooses to initialize for a given cpu model. The expectation is that, with model-specific support layering on top of it, cpu.generic will be the <em>only</em> cpu module delivered in Solaris for the forseeable future.</td></tr><tr><td>cpu.AuthenticAMD.15</td><td>&nbsp;CPU module for AMD family 15. This module was introduced with the original FMA/x64 project putback in which it had full FMA support while cpu.generic had very little FMA support. It is expected that this project to improve cpu.generic will eliminate this deliverable and recast the model-specific support it provides as a model-specific plugin.<br/>CPU Module Implementations</td><th>Model-specific plugin</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>cpu_ms.AuthenticAMD.15</td><td>&nbsp;Detailed model-specific support for AMD family 15 (K8 revisions A through G)</td></tr><tr><td>cpu_ms.AuthenticAMD.15.65.2</td><td>&nbsp;Detailed model-specific support for a particular AMD family 15 cpu with model 65 and stepping 2. It is generally expected that no or few such fine-grained modules will be delivered - the family 15 module can special-case particular models where need be.</td></tr><tr><td>cpu_ms.AuthenticAMD</td><td>&nbsp;"Generic AMD" model-specific support. Such a module may make use of AMD-specific MCA aspects, typically picking on higher-level features that are common to all existing or current AMD processor families. For example, K8 revision F introduced error thresholding registers which are continued in the next family so such support could live here.</td></tr><tr><td>cpu_ms.GenuineIntel.6</td><td>&nbsp;Detailed model-specific support for Intel family 6 (all models and steppings, unless a more-specific module exists for a given cpu in which case that is tried first).</td></tr><tr><td>cpu_ms.GenuineIntel</td><td>&nbsp;"Generic Intel" model-specific support.<br/>Some possible CPU Model-Specific Module Implementations</td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;At most one model-specific plugin should ever augment cpu.generic for a particular chip instance - the most-specific module that exists <em>and</em> matches the vendor/family/model/stepping combination <em>and</em> which chooses to initialize for that cpu. The cpu.generic module should be able to stand alone with no model-specific support, but the intention is that where no fine-grained model-specific support yet exists for a chip at least cpu.AuthenticAMD or cpu.GenuineIntel should assist with some broad vendor-common model-specific aspects. A vendor-common module such as cpu_ms.GenuineIntel may choose to provide full model-specific support for some cpu models; it will require some internal model detection code to tune its behaviour to the particular model it finds itself running on.</p><h2 id="HScope"><span>Scope</span></h2><p>&nbsp;This document will detail the required error-handling aspects of the cpu.generic cpu module together with those of the vendor-common model-specific modules cpu.AuthenticAMD and cpu.GenuineIntel. It will <em>not</em> document error-handling aspects of more-detailed model-specific support such as that for cpu_ms.AuthenticAMD.15.</p><p>&nbsp;We will begin by describing MCA initialization - discovering detector banks, enabling them, and choosing which error types detected by that bank are enabled for machine-check exception (#MC).</p><p>&nbsp;Next we detail our error event response - what action, if any, Solaris should take in addition to the logging the error for diagnosis. Examples are panic, reboot, contract kill, cache flush etc.</p><p>&nbsp;Finally we will detail all error types that can be detected, and what error report classes will be used for these errors. We will also detail the ereport payload included for each error report.</p><p>&nbsp;We will not document diagnosis algorithms here - they will be covered in a separate document. We are concerned only with raising the telemetry upon which the diagnosis engines will operate.</p><p>&nbsp;We will also not be documenting the cpu module interface API, nor the model-specific cpu module interface which layers on top of it. These will be documented elsewhere, with the implementation of the requirements laid out in the present document. For our purposes all we need know is that the overall model is that the cpu module implementation that has initialized for a given cpu instance (usually cpu.generic) performs the bulk of the work and for each cpu module API member there is typically a corresponding model-specifc API member which is called from within the former to perform additional, model-specific actions.</p><h3 id="HAWordOnVirtualization"><span>A Word On Virtualization</span></h3><p>&nbsp;In addition to running natively on x86 hardware, Solaris may find itself as a dom0 to a Solaris xPM hypervisor or a domU for some potentially unknown hypervisor.</p><p>&nbsp;For the Solaris xVM dom0 case, a generic MCA implementation must be designed for the case in which it a privileged domain above a hypervisor - i.e., the design must easily extend to reusing most code between native and dom0 contexts.</p><p>&nbsp;For the domU case we may be paravirtualised or running under full hardware virtualisation - Solaris may be unaware that it does not own the hardware. An implementation must be sure to fail safely in those cases in which the hardware does not appear to behave as it would natively. For example we should not assume the presence of MCA/MCE support from cpu model information alone (i.e., "we know AMD Opteron supports MCA/MCE") but must used CPUID information since the hypervisor may choose to mask some features that would normally be visible via CPUID. Similarly we may discover apparent MCA/MCE support via CPUID, but should be prepared for behaviour such as MCG_CAP indicating zero MCA banks or of all MCi_{CTL,STATUS,ADDR,MISC} appearing to be read-only or read-as-zero.</p><p>&nbsp;A particular design pitfall to avoid is the assumption that every Solaris logical cpu (as listed by psrinfo) corresponds to a unique set of bank control/status/address/miscellaneous registers. This is not the case even when running natively, since in stranded/hyperthreaded designs the individual strands of a single core will typically share the MCA banks of that core. In the virtualised case the virtual cpus presented to a domain may have little or no correspondence to the real cpus, and any correlation need not be fixed (e.g., a single virtual cpu may be mapped onto different real cpus at different times according to the scheduling choices of the hypervisor).</p><h2 id="HMCAInitialization"><span>MCA Initialization</span></h2><p>&nbsp;The implementation should comply with 14.6 of [Intel_vol3A] and 9.4 of [AMD_vol2]: we should enable all detector banks in IA32_MCG_CTL if that register is present, and in IA32_MCi_CTL enable machine-check exception for all error types detected by each MCA bank, allowing for a couple of special cases.</p><p>&nbsp;The cpu module interface must only initiate MCA initialization for cpu instances for which CPUID information indicates both MCA (machine-check architecture) and MCE (machine-check exception) support. We therefore exclude some old cpu models from the start (e.g., AMD K6 and Intel Pentium), but all recent AMD and Intel processors support these features.</p><p>&nbsp;We must initialize via the following steps:</p><ol><li>Read the IA32_MCG_CAP (MCA global capabilities register) and note whether it indicates that the IA32_MCG_CTL is present, and how many MCA banks exist for this processor. If IA32_MCG_CTL is present, initialize it in a later step to enable MCA features - this is a deviation from [Intel_vol3A], however it seems desirable to initialize the individual banks before we enable all detectors. It is not an error for IA32_MCG_CTL to be absent - other initialization below must be performed even when it is absent. Terminate without further initialization if the number of MCA banks indicated is zero.</li><li>If IA32_MCG_CTL is present, write 0 to it to disable all MCA features during configuration below. This is a deviation from [Intel_vol3A].</li><li>Initialize MCA banks from bank 0 onwards (total number as per IA32_MCG_CAP.Count). For each bank that we choose to initialize (bank 0 may be skipped - see the next paragraph) we are inclined to write all 1's to IA32_MCi_CTL, however any model-specific support should be allowed to provide another value. Write 0 to IA32_MCi_STATUS unless model-specific support asks that we omit clearing the status register for this bank; before clearing bank state the inhertited post BIOS/POST bank state should be read and any valid errors logged (conditional upon model and whether this is a power-on or warm reset - see [Intel_vol3A] and [AMD_BKDG_K8F].<br/>&nbsp;If no model-specific support is present (not even the vendor-generic support such as cpu.GenuineIntel) then skip writing to IA32_MC0_CTL (bank 0) for two special cases: Intel family 0x6, in which that register controls platform-specific features (see [Intel_vol3A] 14.3.2.1); and AMD family 0x6 in which bank 0 corresponds to the Data Cache unit but folklore has it that this bank can produce spurious machine-checks, so we leave the register just as the BIOS left it.<br/>IA32_MCi_CTL controls which errors detected by bank i <em>may</em> produce a machine-check exception. This bit is necessary for the #MC, but is not sufficient to guarantee a machine-check for that error type; for example correctable errors will usually not produce a #MC even if their control bit is set in this register. The actual behaviour, and which bits control what error types, are model-specific hence the default initialization value of all 1's.</li><li>Call into any model-specific support so that it may perform additional non-architectural MCA initialization.</li><li>Write all 1's to IA32_MSR_MCG_CTL if present, or whatever value model-specific support cares to change that to. This enables all detectors for those processors that require this enablilng (have this register).</li><li>Associate a handler with vector 0x18 in the IDT. Write to CR4 to enable the machine-check exception.</li></ol><h2 id="HErrorPolling"><span>Error Polling</span></h2><p>&nbsp;For error types that the implementation defines to produce a machine-check exception, such an exception will be generated when the error is detected if the corresponding error bit in IA32_MCi_CTL is set. Which bit controls which error type is model-specific, and the initialization steps above write all 1's to this register.</p><p>&nbsp;For errors that do not produce an #MC at detection, cpu.generic must arrange to poll all MCA banks of every cpu at a fixed interval and raise error reports for any valid errors it finds.</p><p>&nbsp;Error types that will be observed in poll are notionally those not enabled for machine-check in IA32_MCi_CTL; these will have IA32_MCi_STATUS.EN clear when we observe them. Some error types do not produce a machine-check <em>even if</em> their enabling IA32_MCi_CTL bit is set. Such errors, typically hardware-corrected, will be discovered via poll and may have IA32_MCi_STATUS.EN set; we must not treat such observations as "should have machine-checked".</p><p>&nbsp;It may also be the case that the error polling discovers errors that look like they <em>should</em> have produced a machine check exception - say errors whose status indicates uncorrected data, processor context corrupt, etc. Since by default we have enabled all detectors and written all 1's to the bank control registers (allowing model-specific code to modify those defaults) we assume that if such an error did not produce a machine check that is is to be treated as non-fatal, despite apparent indications to the contrary. This might be the case, for example, where machine check for a known spurious case (say arising from a hardware erratum) is suppressed by clearing the relevant control bit.</p><p>&nbsp;So in all cases we do not panic for a polled error, no matter how severe it appears. We will allow model-specific support to override this behaviour by insisting that all observations of some error type are terminal, however they are encountered.</p><h2 id="HErrorDisposition"><span>Error Disposition</span></h2><p>&nbsp;The error handler - machine-check exception handler or poller - needs to decide whether execution may continue or not as a result of the observed error. This decision must be made in cpu.generic without knowledge of the model-specific error details, but should allow any model-specific support that is present to contribute. This differs to past non-generic error philosophy documents which have usually spelled out distinct descriptions of each error type and their required handling.</p><p>&nbsp;There are a number of factors to consider:</p><ul><li>Whether the error was discovered by machine-check or via poll. We take the view that anything discovered by poll does not require a panic or any similar action - we assume that it did not produce a machine check because of some configuration decision made in the BIOS or model-specific code. Telemetry preserved over a warm reset and found at MCA initialization time should be treated as if discovered in poll - never terminal.</li><li>Whether the current processor context is corrupt as a result of this error, as indicated by PCC in the bank status register.</li><li>Whether uncorrected data is present as a result of the error (UC). In most circumstances we are required to panic. Some cpu models and platforms may, however, implement some means of signalling bad data such as through poisoning the ECC of the known-bad data ("data poisoning"). We therefore must give model-specific code the opportunity to further characterize a UC event: to indicate whether the uncorrected data has been poisoned in some way that will prevent it being mistaken for valid data at future use; and to indicate whether the current (interrupted) context is unaffected by the uncorrected data, as may be the case for something like a writeback to memory of bad data displaced from a cpu cache.<br/>&nbsp;Where uncorrected data has not been signalled via some form of poisoning, we view the corruption as <em>unconstrained</em>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;It is possible for an error to be uncorrected (UC) without corrupting the current processor context (PCC clear). For example a load that displaces a bad line from cache may supply good data to the processor but if the bad line is modified the data written back to memory is bad.</p><p>&nbsp;The error handler must determine three characteristics of an error for which we machine-checked, or which we found in a poll but for which EN indicates we should have machine-checked:</p><ol><li>(#MC only) Is the return instruction pointer valid? This is indicated by IA32_MCG_STATUS.RIPV. If invalid, execution is unlikely to be able to continue, but if only a userland process is affected then it may be possible to perform a contract-kill for the affected process contract.</li><li>Whether there is unconstrained bad data present in the system. This is primarily indicated by IA32_MCi_STATUS.UC, but model-specific support should be given the chance to indicate that the uncorrected data has either been eliminated from the system (e.g., by cache flush of unmodified data) or has been marked via some poison indicator to prevent mistaken use. If unconstrained bad data is present in the system then we should panic in an attempt to avoid silent data corruption.</li><li>(#MC only) Whether the current (interrupted) context is corrupted because of the error. This is primarily indicated by IA32_MCi_STATUS.PCC, but model-specific support should be given the chance to indicate otherwise. This does not apply for errors discovered via polling.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;The following code snippet specifies how error disposition is to be determined:</p><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><pre>
	ismc = (took machine check trap?) ? 1 : 0;	/* #MC or poll */
	for i in each MCA bank on the poll/#MC processor {
		if (MCi_STATUS.VAL == 0)
			continue;	/* skip banks with no valid err */
		else
			nerr++;
		pcc = MCi_STATUS.PCC;
		uc = MCi_STATUS.UC;
		/*
		 * Allow model-specific plugin to perform additional error
		 * handling and to indicate error status.
		 */
		ms_disp = model_specific_error_handler();

This is an alternative to delivering such model-specific support via further modules whose pathnames specifies one or more of family, model and stepping.

In Solaris such knowledge is captured in the model-specific memory-controller driver mc-amd whose main purpose is memory topology discovery, address-to-resource translation, and resource-to-address translation.</p><p>&nbsp;A full-featured memory-controller driver is part of any full model-specific FMA implementation. Thus for as long as a particular model is being supported by the generic cpu module with AMD vendor-common plugin, there is likely no full-featured memory-controller driver present.</p><p>&nbsp;For AMD family 0xf revision F and later the Online Spare Control Register exposes 4-bit counts of ECC error experienced by each (<em>channel, chip-select</em>) combination. When an ECC error is observed, usually during a poll, we can check this register to see which combination(s) has/have experienced ECC errors during the poll interval just passed; if we zero the count we can see at the next memory error event which combinations have ticked on again. This therefore provides a generic, if slightly coarse, mechanism for deciding which channel and chip-select contributed an error if we do not have full translation facilities available.</p><p>&nbsp;The resource FMRI array and corresponding resource_counts reflect the above infomation. Diagnosis software must decide how it will handle the case where multiple combinations are identified because each has counted one or more ECC errors during the poll interval.</p><h2 id="HIntelVendorCommonErrorClassification"><span>Intel Vendor-Common Error Classification</span></h2><p>&nbsp;The Intel model-specific support will layer on top of cpu.generic and will be augmented by one or more memory-controller drivers for the off-chip memory-controller hub (MCH).
